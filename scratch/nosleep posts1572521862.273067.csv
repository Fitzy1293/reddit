"Wasps and bees can't mate, can they?","A strange phenomenon occurred in my small town. The bees and wasps began mating and creating these hybrids. No one knew why this was happening let alone *how* this was happening. Bees and wasps aren't able to mate, I'm sure? I hadn't seen any of these ""hybrids"", I didn't think they were real, probably a hoax.

Apparently, one of the kids in my school got bit by one. The bite was on his right forearm. Nothing special, just looked like a regular bump. He said it didn't bother him. That's until one day we were outdoors doing P.E playing football (soccer). He had the ball, and just before he took a shot for the goal, he stopped dead in his tracks and began making guttural sounds. That was terrifying enough, but then he fell to the ground and started shaking uncontrollably.

We found out he died a week later...or so we thought. My dad is a doctor in the local hospital and I overheard him and mum talking about how the kid from my school died. My dad never talks about work, so this was strange. Being a doctor is difficult and the stuff that happens in the hospital isn't something to discuss with family, he says. But he sounded pretty shaken up - another thing I don't associate with my father.

Apparently, according to my dad, the kid from my school didn't ""die"". His brain was still working but blood wasn't flowing through his body; he had no heart beat. The doctors were perplexed. But my dad had more to say, his voice getting quieter and shakier with each passing word, and his head dropped almost as if what he saw was too heavy for his brain to bare. My mother leaned in closer, concern clearly evident on her face, as caressed his cheek with her hand, her own voice trembling, ""what happened?""

""The boy sat up. He fucking sat up on the autopsy table and starting making these horrible gargling noises..."" My father fell silent, his eyes glazed over - I could tell he was reliving whatever he had seen. He didn't go on any further, it seemed as though whatever happened took a toll on his psyche. The night ended with silence and a lot of rumination on my part. Questions upon questions compounding into an incomprehensible mess.

Fuck...I had to get to the bottom of this.

I had a plan, but it wouldn't take affect until a few days had passed. This was because my father was recovering from the seemingly traumatic experience. I felt a little bad that it had piqued my curiosity so much. You see, my plan was to get to the morgue, which is where the guy's body is kept and to see all of this myself.

A few days had passed and my dad regained his lustre and went back to work. I pretended to go to school, but when I got far enough away from home I re-directed my route to the hospital.

I've been to the hospital many times before, and on my excursions through the place I discovered a lot of things, like who had the keys and where they kept them. So I'll spare you the details, but I made it to the morgue. I'll spare you even more details and say that I found the kid's body.

I slowly pulled the body out and immediately jumped back a bit. The kid's eyes were open, and they were looking right at me. The veins in his arm - the one that had been stung, had begun bulging so much that they pierced through his skin. They splurged out like wires, purple and sickly looking. That dead stare sent sharp chills down my spine to my extremities.

In the corner of my eye, I saw something move. It was small. It landed on the wall, I snapped my head around and saw that it was one of those wasp-bee hybrids. I'd never seen one up close, only on the news. It was big, as big as my face.

It flew off the wall at a blinding speed, straight to the exposed dead(?) body in the morgue, landing on its abdomen where it began tearing out the flesh. The hybrid was digging into the body. I stood in place, frozen. All the while this was happening, the kid never took his eyes off me. The hybrid burrowed deeper and deeper until it disappeared, and a smile stretched upon the boy's face. He was enjoying this.

I ran and I kept running. Down the hallways, to the main entrance, I heard my father's voice calling out my name, but overwhelming fear worked my legs. What did I just witness? The boy wasn't dead.

News spreads quickly through the town, and, apparently, what I saw in the morgue had consequences. The boy reigned carnage upon the hospital. It took a lot of effort to restrain him. Last I heard he was taken into a remote location to be experimented on, but he wasn't the only ""test subject"" available now. The people he attacked and killed in the hospital started mutating just like him, and in the birth of these monstrosities, the hybrids were always close by.

My father had been attacked while he was saving others. We went to visit him the in the hospital, in a special wing that had been opened for those affected.

His heart rate monitor showed a flat line, but his eyes were still scanning the room.

And, outside, on the windows, the hybrids were gathering."
The Horns from Hell (Part 2),"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dp5gmm/the_horns_from_hell/)

I yelled in fright and leapt back, banging my foot on the corner of the sink cabinet. The sharp edge sliced through my bare skin, and now I was hopping on one leg, blood pouring from the cut on my foot, my thoughts spinning faster than I could handle. 

*What the hell was going on??*

Acting on autopilot, I pulled open the top drawer and fished around for a band aid. Finding one, I ripped it open and went to apply it to my foot. Only thing was, there was now no cut there to cover. I wrenched my foot as close to my face as I could without toppling over. There was absolutely no sign of any wound. Blood was still trickling onto the floor, but the cut had completely disappeared. It had somehow…healed? In just a few seconds? 

I didn’t know what on Earth to do or how to handle anything anymore, and when my legs began to buckle, I let myself sit down hard on the bathroom tiles. This had to be a dream. No way could any of this be real. 

I slapped myself in the face. ‘Wake up!’ I snarled, and that only succeeded in giving me a sore face. Okay, I needed to calm down. *Deep breaths.* 

Slowly, I began to stand up. I closed my eyes, turned to the mirror, and braced myself. When I opened my eyes, everything would be normal again. This was not real. 

*This was not real.* 

 I opened my eyes and saw the horn sticking out from my head and the broken glasses in the sink, and I wanted to cry. Why was this happening to me? What had I done to deserve this? Gingerly, I reached up, and slid my fingers across the surface of the horn. It was black, and about ten centimeters in length. It tapered up into a curved point at the top, and the base was rounded. The tip felt sharp, and I pressed the pad of my finger against it. A bead of blood welled up, and even as I watched, the skin closed over, the little mark gone in a few seconds. I stared at my finger for a long time, then sighed. 

So this was actually happening. Fantastic. Googling ‘horns grown overnight’ probably wouldn’t get me far. I was on my own with this. 

I turned my attention to the glasses, having dreaded this moment. I picked them up, and the glass in the sink shifted as I moved it. I studied the glasses, a deep pit opening up in my stomach. I could have put it down to a coincidence, that everyone wears sunglasses like this, that just because I met some guy with ones like them yesterday didn’t mean these were his. 

But if that was true, how did they get here then? 

I really didn’t want to think about the next question, but it was unavoidable. 

*If, for some unexplainable, awful reason, they were his…where was* ***he****?* 

I turned, looked out into my bedroom, at my shoes lying dirty and haphazard on the carpet. *And what did I have to do with this?*

Still holding the glasses, I made my way into the living room. The tv remote was on the coffee table, and I picked it up. I paused before clicking the on button, not sure if I wanted to see whatever might be on the news. But I had to, or I’d never gain the courage again. 

And there it was. 

It wasn’t breaking news; people died all the time. But it was important to me. A reporter stood in the middle of a park I walked in occasionally. Police and forensic examiners moved behind her, inside yellow tape marking out a square no civilian was allowed to cross. A square in which a mound that looked suspiciously like a body lay. It was covered by a black sheet, but the shape was clear. 

My worst fears were confirmed as I heard the reporter speak. ‘In the early hours of this morning, 24 year old Dash Carter’s body was found. It appears he was strangled by an unknown assailant. Police are investigating further.’

A photo of Dash popped up next to the reporter. I felt my mouth go dry, my stomach heave. It was him. The owner of the car with red rims and tinted windows. The jerk who’d almost cost me my life. 

And now he’d lost his. 

The more I stared at his picture, the more I hated the feeling that I had something to do with his death. The horn, the glasses, the shoes. Everything was connected. 

I flicked the channel abruptly, not wanting to see anything anymore. It landed on some other news channel, where a 90 year old lady was talking to the camera about some miracle or something. I only caught the last of her sentence. ‘-But I’m telling you, it’s true. I really did die, and now I’m alive again.’ 

I switched the tv off. Delirious old grandma. I had bigger things to worry about. The major thing being  the fact that I was 97 percent sure I’d killed Dash Carter in my sleep and stolen his sunglasses. 

I sank down on the couch, suddenly feeling so tired and sad. Was this karma for something bad I had done when I was younger? Yeah, I hadn’t been the greatest kid growing up, but honestly, who was at 8 or 9? 

Yes, I’d accidently thrown a baseball through my neighbor’s window and blamed it on my brother when I was 13. 

Yes, I’d overfed my sister’s goldfish on purpose when she pissed me off about something, and when they died, refused to come to the ridiculous funeral she made for them. 

Yes, I’d talked back to my mum, argued with my dad. Had fights with my siblings, all of that. But that was all part of growing up. I’d never done anything to ask for this type of retribution. 

I’d broken up with my girlfriend a while back, true, but she’d been cheating on me! Not the other way around. I rubbed my hands across my face. This wasn’t fair. None of this was fair. 

I ran my hands through my hair, taking care not to poke myself on the tip of the horn, and that’s when I felt it. 

On the right side of my forehead. 

A pimple. 

‘No, no, no.’ I muttered frantically, leaping up and running to the bathroom. 

Just like the first one, it was coin sized. A nasty red colour. A definite pimple. 

Except it wasn’t, was it? 

I rubbed the spot in despair, but knowing, that like always, I couldn’t do anything. In a fit of sudden anger, I grabbed the left horn and pulled. Hot pain seared through the side of my head, and I gasped, staggering backwards. 

It wasn’t coming out anytime soon, that’s for sure. 

So was this it? Was I stuck being this…creature? A real life version of Hell Boy. Just not red, tall and badass. 

I wanted to scream, honestly. 

But even that wouldn’t do anything. 

\*\*\*

I stayed inside all day. I couldn’t go out, obviously. Both the horn and the knowledge that the police were looking for Dash’s killer made me stay. I sat on the couch and stared numbly into space for hours. It was weird. My mind felt so crowded with thoughts, but when I tried to focus on one, I just got…nothing.

I felt nothing. 

I had gotten to the point where I honestly just didn’t care anymore. I was a monster, a murderer. A guy who was in way too deep and had no way out. Fun times. The pimple on my right side had grown, I could feel it. I knew when I looked into the mirror, it would seem to be no different, of course. It was itchy as well, and that just made me feel worse. 

It was about 7:30 pm when a loud knock came at the door. I sighed. The police had found me. I knew I could do nothing but face up to what I’d done. No idea how I’d explain the horn, or how I’d actually killed Dash, but whatever. At least in jail I wouldn’t be able to kill anyone else. 

I went to the door and pulled it open. ‘Officers, I-‘ 

I stopped in surprise. It wasn’t the police. It was my ex-girlfriend. Alia stood on my doorstep, head down. I crossed my arms. 

‘What do you want?’ 

She lifted her head, and despite my anger at her suddenly turning up, I felt cold when I saw the ugly bruise across her cheek. She locked eyes with me, and I expected her to say something about my horn, but it never came. 

‘I left a jacket here, I just came to get it,’ she said quietly, and her voice was nothing like the loud, boisterous tones I’d known. 

The sight of her made me momentarily forget about my problems. ‘Are you sure? I thought you did a pretty thorough search of the house when you moved out.’ 

She hugged her arms, looking smaller than ever. ‘I must have left here. I can’t find it anywhere. Look, can I just check your bedroom quickly? I promise I’ll be gone in a second.’ 

This wasn’t the Alia I’d known. She used to be outgoing, mischievous, fun loving. Yeah, she cheated and yeah, I didn’t think much of her anymore, but seeing her like this didn’t give me any pleasure. I had an inkling as to why she’d changed so much though, and it was soon proven true. A car honked behind Alia, and when I looked at the driver, I felt my jaw clench. Alia’s new boyfriend, the one she decided she preferred kissing over me, sat in the driver’s seat. 

He flipped me the bird and took a long drag on the cigarette between his fingers. ‘Hurry up,’ he yelled to Alia, then honked again. 

‘I didn’t think it was possible for Rion to be any more charming, but apparently I’m wrong.’ I said, waiting for the dickhead to point at my horn and laugh, and feeling confused when he didn’t. 

Alia shot me a look. ‘Stop it.’ She pushed past me into the house and went straight down the hall. I closed the door and waited for her to return. When she did, empty handed, I raised an eyebrow. 

‘Told you it wasn’t here.’ 

‘Shut up,’ she replied, but a small smile touched her lips. ‘Guess I was wrong.’ 

‘And am I wrong in thinking you got that shiner by walking into a door?’ 

Her smile fell, and she went to the door. ‘It’s nothing. Forget about it.’ 

She had hurt me badly, and I would never truly forgive her for what she did, but some miniscule part of me still cared for her. I know, it was stupid, but I couldn’t help it. 

‘Alia, you need to leave him. He’s dangerous.’ 

‘He’s fine. I’m fine. Mind your own business.’ She went to open the door, and I put my hand on it, keeping it shut. She turned to glare at me and I reluctantly dropped my hand.

‘Alia, please. Don’t be stupid.’ 

That was the wrong thing to say. She stared at me for a long moment, then yanked the door open and left. I watched her walk away, back to Rion, who snapped at her for taking too long as she got in the car. I felt a muscle in my jaw clench as I watched the way Alia cowered back into her seat, her hair falling back into her face, hiding her from his view. From my position on the doorstep, I saw her glance out the window, back towards me. And I saw, just for a second, the raw desperation and vulnerability in her eyes, the pleading expression she hid from Rion and only showed me. ‘I’m sorry,’ she mouthed. 

I wasn’t sure what she was sorry for, exactly. Cheating on me. Getting with Rion. Staying with him despite what he did to her. 

As Rion put the car in reverse and revved the engine, as Alia sunk down lower past the window, dropping her gaze from mine, I felt the right pimple on my forehead begin to pulse with a dull ache. It was the same feeling I’d got yesterday, in the car pack with Dash. 

I looked at Rion pulling out of my drive, backing over my lawn in the process, calling me a wanker as he sped off, and the ache increased. As the car turned the corner, Alia disappearing from my sight, I felt something like a weird tingle at the base of my left horn. 

And it was then, as I touched my horn gently, I realised neither Alia nor Rion had said anything about it. Anything at all. 

It was like they hadn’t noticed. I turned to go inside, and a little thought stopped me in my tracks. 

*Maybe they just couldn’t see it? Maybe I was the only one who could?*

I hesitated. It made sense, didn’t it? I healed injuries in a few seconds, I disappeared across town during my sleep, and now no one but myself could see the horn growing from my head. If we were following the pattern of weirdness, then it really wasn’t that unbelievable. Right?

Only one way to properly find out. 

I quickly stepped outside, closed my front door and bounded down the path. Crossing the road, I went straight to the house opposite mine and knocked on the door. A middle aged woman answered, looking frazzled. I could smell something burning from behind her and gave a pleasant smile. 

‘Sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you knew where Airedale Court was?’ 

She sighed and pointed to her left. ‘Down there, turn right at the first intersection.’ 

I thanked her and she was already closing the door before I got all the words out. Her rudeness didn’t bother me though; I was focused on more important things. My experiment had given me interesting results. No one could see my horn but me. 

I don’t know what I felt at that moment. Not really. It wasn’t happiness, but it also wasn’t despair anymore. I could still go out in public, still function as a normal person. There *was* just that small problem of me killing Dash Carter, but maybe nothing would come of that? If my horn wasn’t visible, what else could be hidden from the world? 

I walked back to my house, lost in thought, and only came back to reality when I stepped on something on my lawn. Looking down, I saw numerous cigarette butts strewn across the grass. One was still smoldering gently. The tire marks of Rion’s car, scarred into my lawn’s surface, sat next to them. I stared down at the mess for a few seconds, and unbidden, the memory of Alia’s nasty bruise floated into my mind. The way she had looked so scared next to Rion, the way he had snarled at her, the way he had laughed as he ripped up my lawn when leaving. The way people like him, like Dash, existed and ruled over everyone else with fear and force. 

I felt the dull ache return to my pimple, felt like my heartbeat was thudding loudly through my ears, felt my left horn give another small tingle. 

And I decided to try another experiment.

\*\*\*

When I woke the following morning, I had an idea as to what I might see in the mirror. When I got up to look, instead of feeling anguish or frustration, I felt something not unlike triumph. 

My left horn now had a partner.

Overnight, the right pimple had grown into the second glossy horn, and now, looking in the mirror, I had to admit it. Once you saw past the minotaur/Hell Boy look, I looked pretty cool. Pretty badass, to be honest. 

Then I glanced into the sink, already guessing as to what I’d see. 

A single, unlit cigarette lay in the bottom of the sink. I picked it up, and turned to look into my bedroom, just like I had done with the glasses yesterday morning. I distinctly remembered putting my shoes in my wardrobe last night. I’d even taken a photo of them in there, for evidence. They were tossed back under my bed, the laces trailing once more. 

When I turned on the tv in the living room, I knew what would be playing. Sure enough, there she was. The reporter from yesterday, looking too gleeful for someone who was reporting another murder. Probably the biggest stories she’d got all year, in her defense. Nothing ever happened in my town. Not until now. 

’21 year old Rion Harvall, who was last seen late last night, was found dead in his garage by his father, at about 5:30 this morning. Like Dash Carter, he appears to have been strangled. Police say this is the work of the same killer, and a growing investigation is underway. Rion will be dearly missed by his parents, girlfriend and friends.’ 

Not by Alia. Not by me. 

I felt a tingle of guilt towards his parents but shook it off. I couldn’t take back what I’d done. And if I was being perfectly honest…I didn’t want to. I didn’t regret what had happened. 

If you were in my position, had my abilities, what would you have done?

My phone buzzed on the kitchen table, drawing me from my cloudy thoughts. It was the supermarket I’d had the interview with two days ago. I’d got the job, could I start on Monday? 

I could hardly believe it. Things were, incredibly, looking up. The supermarket asked me to come in today to fill out some paperwork, and I did want a walk, so I agreed, told them I’d be there in 20.  

It was sunny outside again. The warm rays shone down on my face; the gentle breeze tossed my hair back. My horns stood up proudly, exposed for everyone to see, but no one did. I passed many people on my way to the store, and each time marveled at their oblivious nature. It was quite amusing, to be honest. It was funny to think that I’d gone from hating these horns to accepting and showing them off. 

I still wasn’t totally at ease with the whole murder side effect, don’t get me wrong, but it helped my conscience to know only those who deserved it suffered. 

I reached the crossing where everything had started, and this time walked by without any trouble. I got to the supermarket with plenty of time to spare, and the manager took me through all the papers I had to sign. One of them was to prevent me from suing them if I was injured in their store, or under their management, and I tried not to laugh at it. If I was injured, I wouldn’t sue them to get my revenge. Not if I could go one better…

(That was a joke, by the way. I wouldn’t kill any of my colleagues. Not unless they were *really* asking for it.)

Leaving the store, I felt better than I had for days. I had a job. Alia was free from her abusive partner. And my horns…those random, weird, slowly-growing-on-me horns…I barely even noticed they were there anymore. 

I turned a corner, and in my happy little bubble, didn’t notice the woman coming towards me. I knocked my hip into something hard, and realised she was pushing a pram and I’d bumped it. ‘Oh, shit, I’m so sorry!’ I said, then my eyes caught up with my brain and I realised I knew her. ‘Oh, hi!’ 

It was the mother from yesterday, the one I’d helped across the road. She began to look up at me, laughing easily. ‘Whoops, sorry about that. Hope I didn’t hit you to-‘ 

She broke off abruptly, stepping back with a gasp. Her eyes were fixed on mine, and she’d gone completely still. 

With a sudden cold chill running up my spine, I realised there was only one reason as to why she was staring at me with such shock. 

She wasn’t looking at my eyes, she was looking above them. 

***She could see my horns.*** 

***The ones I’d thought no one else in the world could see.***"
Farmer Pete's Haunted Kids Corn Maze,"I know the sign said ‘Kids Corn Maze’. But that didn’t stop us. Autumn was in the air, and we were feeling the Halloween spirit. Besides, I think being a young couple, still madly in love allows you to do some kids stuff. It becomes less about the thrill of kids stuff and more about the thrill of being together. The cutesy kids stuff becomes whimsical and charming. I’m pretty sure my girlfriend agreed with me.



Lacey and I had been together for about six months at that point, and she’d told me all about Farmer Pete’s Halloween Haunt over at Downie Farms. It had been something of a family tradition for her since she was young. She didn’t want this to be the first year she didn’t go. Her parents were no longer around and her sister had gone last weekend with her husband and their kids. Usually they brought her with them, but not this year. I suppose they figured she’d want to go with me instead.



I’d never actually done anything at Dowie Farms before. Sure, I’d gone to the storefront to buy produce with my own family. But I’d never done any of their seasonal activities. They really were more for kids, but we weren’t the only couple who’d gone. My friend Stephen had told me he’d gone with his girlfriend last year and he’d seemed to really enjoy it. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t just as excited for it as she was! This was special to her, and so of course it was also special to me. After just six months, I could tell I wanted to spend the rest of my life with Lacey. She was a short brunette with an infectious smile and the cutest laugh I’d ever heard. I’d always thought of myself as a funny guy, and loved to make bad jokes. Admittedly, I did try too hard sometimes. But Lacey didn’t care. She usually laughed anyways, especially if the jokes were bad or just outright dark. We seemed to share the same morbid sense of humor.



The sun was low in the sky by the time we got to the farm. We’d both enjoyed sleeping in before meeting up for lunch and watching a movie together. I’d hoped the crowds at the farm would be gone, but it seemed the attractions were more popular than I’d anticipated.

“Watch out for the stroller.” Lacey said as we were looking for a place to park. A young family with two little kids was making their way down the grass field that was being used for parking and towards us.

“I’ll go for the parents instead.” I said and she giggled.

“If you get them both, maybe one of the kids’ll grow up into Batman.” She raised her eyebrows playfully at me. I stopped the car and let the family pass. Their baby was fast asleep, but their little girl looked at my Nissan Rogue as she passed. She had big blue eyes and was cute as a button. I hoped I’d have a kid like that someday.



We found a parking spot and made our way deeper into the farm. There’d been a good turnout that day. A tractor pulled a cart full of people to the different attractions set up along the farm. Lacey looked at the program on her phone.

“So, we’ve got the Haunted House, the Fairy Village, the Corn Maze and the pony rides…” She said, along with a few other things I wouldn’t remember later. I could see the pony rides up ahead along with the entrance to the corn maze.

“Then the Haunted Hayride begins at 8.” She added, “So we’ve got about four hours.”

The farm was bathed in the golden glow of late afternoon and I wasn’t entirely sure there’d even be four hours worth of activities.



“Well, let’s explore first and see what comes to us.” I said. That seemed good enough for her. We started walking towards one of the distant barns. I could see the Haunted House up ahead, and beside it was a pen with a few of the farm animals. A couple of goats and a tiny horse.  


*‘No thanks! We’re already well fed. We don’t need any more!’* Said a sign on the fence. Lacey stopped a few feet away from it and admired a goat eating some of the fallen autumn leaves. She grinned with an almost childlike wonder at it and I found myself grinning too. The goat continued to eat obviously as it began to shit without a care in the world. Lacey looked at me, smile fading as she shook her head.

“Gross…”

I just chuckled at the obscene absurdity of it all.

“Guess he wants some privacy. Hey, the Haunted House is just over there. Want to check it out?”

She looked over at it before giving a shrug.

“Sure.”

I took her hand as we headed over. I could sense a bit of apprehension as we approached. I knew she didn’t particularly enjoy those haunted houses, but I appreciated the fact that she tried.



“Are you here for the haunted house?” Asked the girl in front of us. She couldn’t have been older than 17. I told her that we were.

“Alright. Well, what scare level do you want? Low, Medium or High?”

I looked at Leigh, and raised an eyebrow. She looked at me, eyebrows raised in turn. Without speaking a word, we had an entire conversation where we negotiated the terms of how scary we wanted the haunted house.

“Medium.” I finally said. Leigh seemed fine with that.

The girl opened the door of the haunted house, stuck her head through and screamed:

“MEDIUM!” before closing the door and grinning at us, “You can go right in.”

I took Leigh’s hand and smiled as I led her through the Medium Haunted House experience.



The set was pretty nice. There were rooms full of creepy dolls, spiderwebs and hanging body parts. Just the atmosphere was enough to creep me out a little. The people wandering through the set and screaming at us were mostly out of costume, but they did their jobs decently. A teenager in a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey seemed to be stalking us from the other side of the far wall. As we made our way through the rooms, she’d peek her head through holes in the wall to scream at the top of her lungs. Every time Leigh flinched, the teenage girl grinned and snickered. That was the worst of it though. Leigh was tense and laughing nervously by the time we left, and I kissed her hand to thank her for trying for me.

“That was alright.” She said softly, “The screaming was a bit much.”

“It kinda was. I’m glad we settled on medium. Kinda wish we did low actually.”

“Next time.” She said cracking a soft smile. She had the cutest smiles in the world.

Up ahead I spotted a sign for the corn maze.

“Want to give that a try?” I asked, gesturing to it.

“Yeah, for sure! Let’s do it!” She squeezed my hand as we headed towards the maze.



The old stalks of corn stood tall and a wooden sign depicting a zombie pointed the way. The word ‘ENTER’ was written across his arm. Lacey and I watched as a small family disappeared into the corn and we followed them. The fallen stalks across the dirt path crunched under our feet as we made our way through the maze. Above the corn, I could see the grain silo against the late afternoon sky. It was a useful landmark to give me an idea as to where we were.

“Left or right?” Lacey asked as we reached a fork. The family ahead of us was long gone.

“Right.” I said. It looked like it went deeper into the maze, and honestly I kinda wanted to get lost. It was part of the experience, wasn’t it?

Lacey just smiled and made her way down the right hand path and I followed her.

“Aww, honey look!”

She paused as I caught up with her.

“It’s Elsa.”

Propped up on a post in the corn was the vaguely human shape of the beloved Ice Queen from Frozen. She looked to be just a human shaped sack dressed in clothes with a face painted on. An old blue dress and white shawl adorned the figure. She had no hair, but someone had tied a wig into a braid and draped it over her shoulder. It was as good as it needed to be.

“That’s cute!” Lacey said, and I snapped a picture. She continued onwards, and stopped to point out Olaf a few feet away.

“He’s even got a little sign.” She said. I could see it down by his feet.

*‘How many stomachs does a cow have?’* There were 4 possible answers down below.

“That’s cute.” Lacey said again before we continued on.



A few feet later, we also saw Peppa Pig and her family, as well as what I think was Paw Patrol characters. Lacey didn’t stop to fawn over these ones as much. But we did call them out as we saw them. We paused for the educational little signs as well.

*“Did you know that baby goats are called Kids.”* She read off one of them. She looked at me.

“I dunno, did you know that?”

“I had no idea.” I said half jokingly,

Lacey nudged me as we continued on.

“Is that Frozen again?” I asked as I saw a white shawl in the corn ahead of us. Her eyes narrowed as she approached.

“It looks like it… Yeah… That’s Elsa. Did we go in a circle?”She looked around, but this area of the maze didn’t seem familiar.

“I don’t think so…?”

“Maybe they just repeat.” I said and shrugged. Lacey seemed to accept that as an answer.

“Probably…”

She looked down the aisles of the maze, and I looked around for the grain silo I’d been using to keep us oriented.

“Let’s try left.” I said when I spotted it, “That should take us closer to the exit.”

Leigh continued off to the left, and as she did, I heard movement behind me. On instinct, I looked back, expecting to see some other patrons of the maze approaching us from behind. Instead I saw nothing. Not even the white shawl of the Elsa dummy. I frowned but kept walking. I didn’t think too much of it. There wasn’t really a reason to suspect anything sinister. Not yet at least.

Leigh stopped ahead of me when she saw another trivia sign. This one had been knocked over. She bent down to pick it up and set it right, but her brow furrowed as she read it.

“How many children did Lightning McQueen kill…?” She murmured, and looked at me, “Lightning McQueen didn’t kill kids!”

“Teenagers pulling a prank maybe?” I asked as I read the sign. I turned it around and knocked it into the corn, then gave the base a kick to hide it.

“That’s just mean. Kids might read that.”

Lacey nodded in agreement before continuing deeper into the maze.



Around a bend in the corn, we paused as we reached a dead end. The Paw Patrol figures were waiting for us. There were 4 dogs painted on old sacks and they were placed side by side at the edge of the corn. Their eyes stared down the narrow rows, directly at us. It felt like they were waiting for us.

“Guess we’re intruding.” Lacey murmured, “They look upset.” She smiled at me and began to turn around. I didn’t leave just yet though.

They did kinda look upset… Their eyes seemed way too focused on us. I turned away, looking back as if I was expecting them to follow me. The Paw Patrol did no such thing. They just continued to stare… Of course they did. They were just sacks painted to look like fictional dogs! They’d probably been put there to soften the blow of a dead end for any kids. This was a kid friendly maze after all.

“There’s another one of those signs.” Lacey said from up ahead of me.

“What’s it say this time?”

*“How many teeth does Tom Hanks have?”*

I looked over her shoulder at the sign, which read exactly that. But the multiple choice answers underneath were even weirder.  


*-32*  
*-427*  
*-8021*  
*-Infinite*  


“If that’s supposed to be a joke, I don’t get it.” I said.

“Me neither.” Lacey murmured. She looked up at the maze ahead of us, and bit her lip as she spotted Sheriff Woody peeking out of the corn rows.

“Christ…”

“That’s not creepy at all.” I murmured. “It’s just a prank, hun.”

I took her hand and escorted her past the beloved animated Sheriff, glaring suspiciously at him all the while.

“Let’s just get out of this maze.” Lacey said, “This is starting to wear out its welcome.”

We picked up the pace as we walked.



Somewhere in the distance, I could hear movement in the corn. The sky was a pastel pink with orange hues and the air around us was dead silent. No kids. No animals. Just our footsteps and the rustling in the corn. Lacey looked back anxiously and held my hand tight. Ahead of us, I saw another sign with a farm fact posted on it.  


*‘When you die, who takes you to Hell?’*  


I didn’t stop to let Lacey get a look at it. I just kept walking.

“We should be almost out.” I murmured as I looked at the grain silo against the darkening sky. It seemed a lot closer than it had been before… That was good, right?

“Yeah…” She didn’t sound convinced. Still, we kept walking. We kept walking until we saw the shapes ahead of us. Then we both stopped in our tracks.



Lacey’s hands went to her mouth, as if masking a scream. I could only stare in horror. In the path ahead of us were three corpses. Not props. Real corpses. They’d belonged to the family who had come in ahead of us. I recognized the jacket on the little boy, who thankfully lay face down in the dirt… I would have broken down crying if I’d had to see his face.  


The Father lay partially in the corn, eyes staring vacantly up into the sky. His mouth was open in a scream of terror and blood trickled down his slit throat. The Mother lay in a heap on the ground. I could see blood on her white shirt though, enough to stain parts of it a dark red. The blood was still wet. These were fresh kills.

“Oh my God…” Lacey murmured, “Oh my God…”

She pressed herself against me and I wrapped my arms protectively around her.

“I’ll call the Police…” I murmured and reached for my phone. Attempting to dial anything failed though. I had no signal. Neither did Lacey.



My heart skipped a beat as I heard the corn rustle behind us. Both of us turned around immediately. There, standing in the middle of the corn maze was Peppa Pig. The burlap she was made from was stained with blood. The wooden post that kept her in place was planted firmly in the ground and she stared at us defiantly. She sure as hell hadn’t been there before

“We’re leaving… Now…” I murmured. I looked up at the Silo before taking Lacey’s hand and pulling her into the corn. I was done with the Maze. I just wanted out. We moved as fast as we could, and I kept that silo in sight. It wasn’t far… Maybe just a five minute walk. We could make it five minutes, right? Behind me, I could hear the corn rustling. I could hear movement. My heart was racing and it almost stopped when I heard Lacey cry out.

“Lacey!”

“I’m okay! It… It’s another fucking sign…”

There amongst the corn, I could see it. In the fading twilight, I could only barely read the text.  


*‘Who will find you when we are done?’*

*-Your Mother*  
*-Your Father*  
*-The Police*  
***-No one***



The words *‘No One’* were circled in blood. I looked up, just past the sign and through the corn, I could see something blue and white. I could only barely make out the painted on eyes of Elsa watching us and beside her, I swore I could see Sheriff Woody. There was a rustling beside us, and I turned to see Peppa Pig, almost close enough to touch us. Leigh let out a startled cry, and shrank back. I grabbed her hand and started to run.  


It was barely even a minute before we broke through the corn, but by God that minute felt like it took forever… We did break through though, and found ourselves on another path of the maze.

“Damnit…” Lacey murmured, “Let’s just cut through the corn again… Then we’ll call the cops…”

I wasn’t so sure that was a good idea. The Grain Silo didn’t seem to be any closer… It seemed to be in the exact same place.

“I don’t think we should.” I said, “I… I think they didn’t like that…”

Lacey opened her mouth to argue with me, before falling silent. The corn rustled around us, and she inched closer to me.

“Maybe they didn’t…” She murmured, “Let’s just go, then… We’ll get out normally…”

She took my hand and took off down the row. Our walking quickly turned into running.



I spotted additional signs on the path, more than I’d seen before. I briefly saw glimpses of Woody, Elsa, Peppa Pig and others amongst the corn. Pooh Bear watched us from one fork in the road, and when I looked back I saw him and Tigger standing side by side in the path, as if blocking off our return.

“Where’s the fucking exit…” Lacey said under her breath, “Come on, come on…”

She checked her phone again, hoping for a signal but still found nothing. I just held her hand and focused on continuing forwards. The sky was getting darker and I could hear the movement amongst the corn.

They were coming.

“There’s something up ahead!” Lacey said, “I think I see the exit!”

We broke into a run, sprinting for the escape. Sure enough there was a clearing just ahead of us… Maybe it was a way out! It had to be!

As we emerged into the clearing though, we realized the truth. It was not an escape. This was something else entirely.



My breath caught and my blood froze in my veins as I looked at the figures around us… All human, all strung up like scarecrows. I could see the family we’d discovered earlier amongst the corpses. But there were so many more… Fifteen, twenty perhaps. Maybe even more.

“There are two empty ones…” Lacey said softly, and my eyes were drawn to them. They were set to face each other… and somewhere in the deepest part of my mind, I knew why.

We wouldn’t be dead when they mounted us… They wanted us to watch each other die. That was where the thrill was, wasn’t it? The corn rustled behind us, and I turned to see Peppa Pig watching us from the edge of the corn. It may have just been the darkness, but I could have sworn she was smiling… I could have sworn that her mouth was open and I could see drool dribbling down her chin.  


Lacey took my hand, tears beginning to stream down her cheeks. We both took a step back as Peppa Pig loomed into the clearing. I could see Elsa and Woody behind her. I could hear the rustling of their movements. They moved bonelessly and shuffled forwards. It was inhuman and strange to watch. But they did it all with single minded purpose. They had come for us, and nothing would deter them.

“Let’s go…” I said, “Run, RUN!”

She didn’t need to be told twice.



Again we ran, breaking through the wall of corn ahead of us. This time we had no direction. We just wanted to get away from the horrible things that were following us, and I didn’t know if that was even possible at this point. We ran blindly, hands linked as we fled, swatting corn out of our way. We ran until we broke through the corn one last time and stumbled out into the main event area.



Lacey broke down crying as she saw the Haunted House we’d been through. I saw the Pony giving its final ride of the day.

“We’re out. WE’RE OUT!”

She threw her arms around me and I hugged her back in turn. She laughed that laugh I’d fallen in love with and I was laughing too… Until I saw it. At the edge of the corn, I could see Peppa Pig watching us. I held my girlfriend closer, leering at the creature that had hunted us, silently praying it would retreat. It did. Slowly, Peppa Pig pulled back until she vanished into the corn. She’d been there for only a few seconds. Long enough to let us know how close they’d been to catching us… Then they were gone, and so were we.



We didn’t report the bodies to the Police. Lacey didn’t agree with that, but I know she understood. I didn’t know if the Police would even find any bodies, and even if they did, my story about being chased by Peppa Pig and Elsa through a corn maze would sound too insane to warrant checking out. Even if I’d lied and only said that I’d discovered the bodies, the Police would still have questions I couldn’t answer. In the end, it was easier not to bother.



I love Lacey.  One day I want to marry her. She is my best friend, she is the love of my life. She is my partner in crime and in everything else. I would do anything for her and with her. But I will never return to Downie Farms, regardless of what her family tradition is, and I don’t think she will either."
Late night in the morgue,"I'm sure you guessed already but I work in a hospital as a Doctor. No, I'm no forensic pathologist, but I was originally training to be one before I decided I preferred the living instead and assisting them. But after years of med school, I have found myself working in this small hospital sometimes assisting the incompetent forensic pathologist we have here.

Sometimes they won't be sure of something so they ask me to double-check or I've spotted a huge mistake in the deceased's medical files and have had to check the bodies personally to find the real issues. This has been going on for years though and is honestly pretty casual in my hospital that I assist in the alternate field. I never enjoy it though, despite the preservation of the bodies with cooling, they still smell.

It was late on Saturday night, well past my time to leave, my shift had ended 3 hours ago but Ralph messed up again. I've put in several complaints about his casual misconduct and sheer stupidity but somehow he remained to keep me up fixing his mistakes. The patient in question Quentin Ramirez was shot to death by police.

He was a homeless crazy who stabbed a woman in the chest 6 times and was shot 8 times by police from what I recall. Ralph had his cause of death written as heart failure the idiot.

I took a look at him, he had the stitching from the autopsy forming that capital 'Y' on his chest and seven bullet wounds across his torso, 5 in the guts and 7 in his chest, 2 in his left thigh, the last was just above his eyebrow. I understand why he had to be killed, I understand he was out of control and had already killed a civilian but 15 times seemed unnecessarily excessive. 1,2 or 3 should be the most you have to shoot someone.

I overheard some staff speaking about Ramirez saying he was already down when two other officers arrived and let off a couple of rounds to be safe. It's like a madhouse in here. Ramirez was a thin, elderly Latino man, aged 66 and only 100 pounds. His body was nothing special. He was thin, you could almost make out his rib cage, his skin was sun-browned from years of not using sun cream and just letting himself burn under the sun. He had several scars along his forearms, hands and fingers.

X-rays showed that the bones appeared to have been broken several times and all healed improperly. The joints looked above average thickness and size. Like the bones had reconstructed themselves far too many times. Similar activity appeared in his skull specifically the forehead. But on the outside, there were no visible signs of this. He didn't appear big-boned, his hands weren't large or swollen and neither was his forehead.

I was sick of this. There was nothing to discuss. Quentin Ramirez had an odd bone structure and was shot to death. I called Ralph this time to maybe think about how much of an idiot he could be. I used the phone from his desk and began ringing, the first time nothing but the second time he quickly picked up.

""Yeah what?"" He groaned.

""Hey, it's me, Thomas."" I said,

""Hey it's like midnight, you know I start early cause of traffic, what is it?""

""Guess where I am?... I'm fixing your fuck up... you listed Quentin Ramirez's cause of death under heart failure. He was shot to death. He even has a bullet wound in his skull!""

""Hey... just listen, man, it looks like a screw up I know but lemme talk.""

""What the hell is there to talk? 15 times he was shot!""

""Yeah, he stabbed a girl in front of a cop, dragged her away and kept stabbing her. He called for back up and once the old bastard dropped the woman the cop shot him in the head..."" Ralph said pausing for my response

"" Congratulations, a guy gets shot in the head and you still list it as heart failure,"" I said cynically

""NO! He didn't go down. Why do you think other cops even arrived and shot him. 3 cops and 14 more bullets. He wouldn't go down. He even ran at them. Then he just stopped. He had a goddamn heart attack. But something was happening to his hands and forehead. Cops couldn't explain so we got the X-rays. I told em what I found and they said that couldn't explain it.""

""Oh man you know I don't believe any of that crap.""

""I'm serious, check out the police report and check out his heart. Talk to me again in the morning I'm done with this weird shit today."" Ralph hung up.

I was about done with his shit when I slammed the phone on his desk. I was reading through the police report and everything he had just told me was true. Ramirez was unstoppable.

15 rounds all hits including a headshot. But there was something about his hands and forehead. Something was growing from his forehead and his hands were large, sharp and glowing. What the actual fuck I thought to myself. Was this some kind of messed up joke gone way too far I originally thought.

But then I decided to take a second look at Ramirez's body specifically his arms and forehead. I moved his long matted grey hair away from his face and held a small light to his forehead. I found scars just under his hairlines two of them both recent they couldn't have been older than a year or so. They looked like exit wounds like something had forced its way out. I lifted his head to search for anything that could've penetrated the back of his skull. Nothing.

The room felt colder, I even felt a shiver crawl its way up my spine. I decided that it was late and that I would look further into the possibility of heart failure then discuss it later with Ralph. I had to get some sleep.

I closed Ramirez into his drawer. I packed up and cleaned the equipment I used and was about to leave when I was caught staring at the floor. It was covered in a black fog, it wasn't smoke, it wasn't rising to the ceiling, nothing smelt like it was burning if it was smoke I definitely would've smelt it by now. The room instead got only colder. I could see my breath thicker before it was barely noticeable now great white whisps were pouring out.

I panicked as the black fog grew thicker and I could no longer make sense of the floor. It was so thick and then came the smell. The vile smell, it was gut-wrenching. I couldn't breathe through my mouth anymore it was disgusting. I tried rushing to the door but the fog slowed me, I was practically tripping over my own feet.

I turned around to see the fog emanating all from Ramirez's draw. The corners of the small square door were spilling the fog out into the room. The smell became more familiar, it smelt like someone had been rotting.

I froze in fear, it wasn't the cold that did this, if anything I preferred the cold in comparison to warm weather, so it didn't bother. The only thing that bothered me was the heavy breathing coming from Ramirez's drawer. It didn't sound natural, like a human's breathing at all. It was almost like a low growl.

Then came the screaming, it was so deafening. One would think the drawer would muffle the sound in some way but then again everything that's happening right now shouldn't be happening. I wanted to run for the door again, to get out of whatever the fuck this was but the black fog erupted in front of the door covering it completely. It didn't fill the room, it only hid the door.

I tried forcing my hands through it and feeling for the handle, but I couldn't feel anything, the door should've been there but there was nothing. I reached out to my elbows and still nothing. The door should've been right there, my hand should've been going through it, it was that close. But nothing.

The screaming had stopped. Instead, there was a loud bang and a dent in the door holding Ramirez back. Again and again, more dents grew in the door until it finally flew off into the black fog covered floor. A burst of fog came out before it slowly filtered out like before. I nearly cried out like a madman when I saw the glowing red eyes hiding in the chamber.

They were staring me down looking right through me. It hurt. It hurt to have that thing look at me. I just wanted it to go away, to shut its eyes and stay dead like it was supposed to. But then it's claw-like hands latched onto the sides of the opening. Twisted, jagged claws scraping the sides. It leapt out and stood tall. I was a blubbering mess, it wasn't tears or screaming, I was losing my damn mind.

Ramirez's stitching had been pulled apart and his chest opened. Inside was an orange glow and a black ribcage. I looked up to his face and only saw horns. They were about 6 inches long, curving back past his fringe. The tips were glowing yellow like molten steel.

He stared me down and retrieved a strange stone. It was a circle, like a sigil covered in strange markings all glowing red. Ramirez then found a scalpel and jabbed it into his shoulder, drawing out blood which he then wiped across the circular shaped stone whilst muttering something.

He returned attention to me. He threw the table in front of him away effortlessly while still staring into my eyes still.

""I'm sorry... but I have to kill it."" He said to me as his horns and body began glowing more violently. He kneeled down to me. I still couldn't breathe from the fog, I could see that he was breathing but could feel no breath. His teeth appeared sharpened and larger but none of that mattered.

His hand buried itself into my chest, ripping into me. I somehow still remained conscious. My eyes fixated on the horrid sight, I realised he wasn't mindlessly tearing away at me, he was making an incision. The pain broke me. I was screaming so loud for help, for anyone who might hear me. Someone must've been on this level showing up for a shift or maybe a janitor just cleaning. Anybody. Ramirez had finished opening up my chest. He then plunged his hand into the wound and pulled out my heart.

I began tasting iron in my mouth from all of the blood filling it. My clothes were stained red, the only reason I couldn't see the new red splattered floor was because of the fog but I felt it. For some reason, the pain stopped but I could still see everything. I thought I was dead. I think it might've been too much for my brain process.

Suddenly a knocking could be heard from the door beyond the cool room. ""Anybody in there? Hey is everything okay? Heard screamin!"" A guard called out.

Ramirez slashed at the door behind me opening it and dragging me into the light-filled hallway directly in front of a security guard. ""Holy fuck!"" He yelled drawing his gun. I was only able to mumble the words ""Don't let him kill me."" Before Ramirez dragged me into the Janitors closet and covered the door with fog.

""IN HERE! SOMETHING TOOK HIM INTO THE JANITOR CLOSET!"" I heard the guard screaming for his pal.

Ramirez got busy he took the sigil and placed it into my chest. I began to feel pain again. Something felt odd. Like my insides were crawling towards the sigil stone. Soon enough my wound closed itself but there was still burning in my chest.

Ramirez stood up proud almost with a crazed smile across his face, his wounds were all gone. The gaping hole in his chest was all but gone, replaced with actual flesh. His horns had faded away like the black fog covering the door. The guard was still banging loudly against the door.

""I did not want to hurt anyone else today but there is no other way to kill it."" He said calmly as the guard burst in with his gun out, Ramirez jabbed him with the scalpel in the eye, retrieved the revolver from the guard and let him squirm in pain as he held his hands close to his eye but not daring to touch the scalpel. Ramirez drew the gun on me. The other guard, however, shot Ramirez before he could pull the trigger on me.

""Suspect down, I need medical help here please!"" He called out over his radio. I was still in shock, I couldn't move or think, it was all blank space to me for what seemed like hours or days. The next clear memory I have is whispering. I was in a hospital bed, staring at the wall, listening to something whisper in my head. ""It's you and me now if you died I would find another, but he made us one. If you die, I die. I'm hungry... if we're going to survive I need something from you. All I can do is give you the strength to do it. Find them, find the wicked we need to cull them from the shepherd's herd.""

I haven't been a doctor for years, but hunting is a lucrative business, it keeps me well-fed, strong, and the herd is a little safer from the wolves."
Smoke Without A Fire,"My fire alarm went off this morning. I was getting ready to leave for work - actually, I was rushing to leave for work because I had been lying in front of my fan heater, unwilling to go outside into the cold. My flat is in a poorly maintained Victorian building and only has cracked single glazing, so it’s always freezing, especially with the first frost of the year wrapping its fingers around Northern England.

 I’ve been finding it harder and harder to leave the flat in the mornings the past few weeks. I get up at five thirty in the morning and should head out soon after for the train but I always seem to find myself wrapped in a blanket in front of my little portable heater until the last possible minute.

That’s what happened this morning. I looked at my watch and realised that I was already late for the first two trains I could catch, and if I didn’t want to be late for the third day in a row I would have to leave now. I was halfway out the door, briefcase in hand, when the alarm went off.

For such an old, creaky building it’s one hell of an alarm. Imagine the worst migraine you’ve ever had, amplify it, and now imagine that pain is a sound. The landlord may not have double glazed the windows, but he certainly didn’t skimp on this alarm. The only problem was that I live in a three room apartment, and none of those rooms were on fire.

I ran downstairs. The building’s alarms were all controlled from a central command box at the bottom of the stairs, and it had an LED display that showed which flat the alarm originated from. According to the box, mine was the only one on fire.

I looked up the stairs. I could see into my apartment from where I stood, and it was very much not on fire. Sighing, I pressed the button to silence the alarm before it annoyed the other residents, and went back upstairs to grab my things for work and double check that the building was definitely not burning down.

I missed the last early train, thanks to the weird not-fire. No one at work said anything, though. That was nice. I had a lot to do and usually everyone’s super chatty. I think I managed to go the whole day just slogging through my work, not making conversation.

 I guess it was a bit weird. Normally I’m the first to join in on the team banter and have a laugh, but the atmosphere just wasn’t there today. I guess sometimes adulting is just like that. Sometimes you laugh and joke and mess around with your friends, sometimes you eat lunch alone. The peace and quiet is nice, I suppose. Every once in a while.

Things have been pretty quiet since I got home too. The alarm hasn’t gone off again, and my home is still very not on fire. If anything, the air feels damp, like someone has hidden a giant humidifier somewhere behind a door. And there’s a smell, though I can’t quite place it, sort of sickly and unpleasant. I’ve sent a text to the landlord, but he hasn’t replied yet. Probably busy. I’ll call him in the morning.

I don’t really know why I’m posting this. I should be asleep right now, but every time I start to drift off I dream I can hear the fire alarm and wake right back up again. But everything’s quiet, despite the memory of the dream ripping through my head. It’s silent, really. Even the cats in the alley aren’t making any sound.

I tried messaging my boyfriend just to pass the time while I wait to fall asleep again. I guess his phone must be on silent.

I guess that’s why I’m posting here. It’s been a weird rough day and I want to tell someone about it. I know everyone has off days, but I feel isolated, like I’m behind a sheet of glass and nothing, not even sound can get in or out.

Can anybody hear me?"

It wasn’t until the next day anyone came for me.

Hours of me staring at the ceiling and trying to figure out what emotions were mine and which were Ragna’s when I heard the cell door open.  I could sense her there, staring at me, her confusion, her anger.  It wasn’t even anger directed at me, it was a self-loathing of sorts.

“There’s some explaining you need to do,” Ragna forced a smile, “I don’t know why they’d lock you up for protecting my Rachel, but-”

I stood up, and knew what to say to get things straightened out, “I love her.”

Ragna’s smile vanished, “What?”

“I said,” I walked right up to Ragna, getting right into her face, “I love Rachel, when I saw her today I fell in love with her.  Her eyes, even when they’re angry, the fire inside of them took hold of me and all I wanted to do was get lost inside of them.”

Ragna’s shock faded and she regarded me, “How…?”

“I don’t know?  You tell me!” I shouted.

Ragna’s eyes grew wide, “Oh, oh dear.” 

“What did you do to me?!” I demanded.

Ragna grabbed my shoulder, squeezing hard, reminding me of my place.

I fell to my knees in pain.  A shiver went through me as her grip threatened to shatter my shoulder blade or at least dislocate my shoulder.  My stomach dropped as she held tight.

“I’ve killed others for less.  I understand you’re upset, but,” she warned, “don’t push it.” 

“You’re inside my head messing with it, aren’t you?” I accused.

Ragna shook her head, “No,” Ragna heaved a sigh, “I pushed my anger for Captain Sofia Vázquez into that vial, I hoped my hatred of *her* would transfer to *you*.  Nothing more.”

“Well I hate that woman with every fiber of my being, just hearing her name makes me angry,” I looked up at her, “But I got more than your hatred.”

“An error I won’t repeat,” Ragna let go of me, “I’m sorry Madison.  It was a rash thing to do.”

“So now what? ” I said, getting to my feet.  Ragna’s feelings for Rachel were intense, it was hard to ignore them.

Ragna was silent, deep in thought.

Whatever was going on inside her mind, I hoped she was thinking of a solution.

There were a few minutes of silence before I interrupted her, “So, ideas Ms.Wizard?”

Ragna’s resolved cracked and she gave me a concerned look, “I can traipse about someone’s mind and change their thoughts, but what I did wasn’t rearranging memories, Madison, it was more subtle.  That’s why I thought it would not be so invasive.”  she grumbled, “This is something that requires someone with more empathy than anything else.  The only woman I know who could is Priestess Tasha.  She runs the Catholic Church here.”

“I haven’t seen her since the princesses left,” I pointed out.

“That figures,” Ragna stated, “I’ll set her sister, Xei, to seek her out but I am doubtful if that will bear fruit,” Ragna grimaced, “We will need to go outside of Penthesil for this.”

“Outside?” I asked, an eyebrow raised.

[…](https://www.trzcacak.rs/myfile/detail/248-2485080_omega-png-transparent-background-omega-symbol-png.png)

We were outside the walls of Penthesil, where Ragna had called one of her mages.

Standing before me was a tall bald man with vibrant green eyes.  He was athletic and wore a similar uniform as Syria and Alexis did.  I guess the mages had to match.  He peered into my eyes, holding my head in his hands.

“If you keep doing that, I will ask you to buy me dinner,” I said, getting frustrated with being manhandled.

“Ya aint me type, love,” a thick cockney accent confirmed.  “'eaven and 'ell this is a Elliot Ness, Mistress.”

“Rasper, I do not need a ‘I told you so,’” Ragna protested.

“Nah, yeah ya do!” Rasper, the man staring at me, shouted, “Wot did ya do ter this girl?”

“I’m not a girl,” I growled.

Rasper bopped my nose.

My anger vanished, “I’m sorry…”

“She’s loike a younger version of ya,” Rasper said, casting a glare at Ragna, “Science, genetics, engineering, telepathy, even nanomachines, that’s wot yer good at, Mistress.” Rasper pointed to me, “Wot the Gypsy Nell did ya try?”

Ragna took a deep breath, “I pushed my hatred for a specific woman into a genetic treatment for her,” Ragna confessed.

“Bloody ‘ell!” Rasper shouted, “Ya infused 'er wif your 'ate!  'eaven and 'ell why do ya 'ate 'er, if ya daan't mind me askin?”

I had difficulty understanding half of what Rasper said.  It sounded like English, but it wasn’t.

“That vile woman, Sofia,” even as Ragna said the name my blood boiled.

Rasper booped my nose again and snapped me out of it.

Ragna continued, “she and her team left Rachel bedridden!  A bullet ripped her apart!” Ragna growled, “it’s a miracle her uterus survived, but her digestive tract is in shambles, she lost a kidney, she’ll be shitting into a bag for the rest of her life!” Ragna regaled us, “and that horrid woman threatened to blow her head off!  She shoved a gun into Rachel’s mouth!” Ragna barely could calm herself, “I’ve never been so helpless.” 

“Okay, na ya wonder why this girl's got feelings for Rachel?  Wot, ya fin' your 'ate 'ad nah source?  It's the ovver side of the coin, Mistress, that bein' love!  They’re tied at the bloody 'ip!!”  Rasper grumbled.  “Ya cocked this up well and good.”

“I’m seeing why my brother dislikes you, Rasper.” Ragna pointed out.

“Ya kna why? it’s 'cause i’m right!” Rasper pointed out.

Ragna looked away.

“Can you fix me?” I asked.

Rasper grumbled, “Love, Ya 'ave Bo-le Of Glue sets of emotions stuck in yer heart,” he explained, “Emotions 're strong and Ragna’s not dealin' wif weak ones ter start.” 

“So that’s a ‘no’?” I asked.

Rasper sighed, “do ya love someone else?”

My cheeks turned red, “I don’t know, to be honest.  It’s complicated.”

Rasper grinned, “Oh?  Wait that I can work wif…” 

“Huh?” I asked, confused.

Rasper looked to me, “This person, ya Bobby ya love them?”

I recalled Hilly and me in bed my cheeks went red.  The answer was: I wasn’t sure.  If we met another way, perhaps, but despite me confronting Hilly, the rape still happened.

“Oh na if that aint the cutest fin',” Rasper said smiling at me, “now I can fix this up in a jiffy, at least part of it. Ya still garn ter 'ate that Sofia woman, but we can at least get the bleedin' majority of your emotions wound up right 'ere.”  pink fire engulfed his finger and he tapped my forehead.

My head spun and my stomach was in knots, it blew my head up like a balloon.  A moment later, everything seemed to slide back into place.

“Okay, garn ter test this aahhht,” Rasper looked to me, “Queen Rachel?”

I stared at him, her name didn’t elicit any response like before. 

“Good,” he smiled, “'oo were ya maybe in golden dove wif?”

“Hilly?” I blushed, and my heart started to race thinking of her, “Oh…”

“So, just so you’re aware, I didn’t tamper wif your thoughts. those 're your emotions, they’re just stronger. fin' of it loike this: ya had two cups of tea, one was strong, the other was… well, it was still tea.  Na they’re in the same cup, ya got me?” Rasper explained.

“Why is it always tea with brits?” I asked.

Rasper laughed, he then turned to Ragna, “Listen ter this one, she’s the chuffin' only wahn who’s gonna call yah’ aahht on yer bullshit.”

Ragna turned to me, “Well… seems that makes you my advisor, Madison.” 

I cleared my throat, getting to my feet, “Okay.”  

Ragna faced Rasper, “Thank you, you can return to my brother.”

Rasper grinned, “I was wonderin’ if I could ‘ead back to the men’s village fer a tic?”

Ragna smiled, “Oh?  What’s his name?”

Rasper’s cheeks reddened, “I… daan’t kna yet.”

Ragna rolled her eyes, “have fun.”

Rasper bowed and vanished in a puff of smoke.

Ragna turned to me, “I have some armor to give you, and a bit of an apology.”

“What?” I said, shocked.

“Magic isn’t my strong suit,” Ragna admitted, “so far this is twice now I’ve used it and twice I’ve done undo harm.  I think I’m rather done with the stuff. For that, Madison, I apologize, I shouldn’t have used you as a guinea pig.  That Sofia woman…”

“I know.  You said you were helpless,” I frowned, “I know what that’s like.”

“Also my fault?”

I gave Ragna a nod.

Ragna’s face fell, “you’re the only person who knows this much about me outside of Rachel and my brother.” she looked to the gate leading back to Penthesil.  “I feel naked.” 

Did I have sympathy for Ragna?  I did my best to determine if this was my emotion or Ragna’s.  It was clearer to tell now.  Whatever Rasper had done, I now knew when the alien emotions were there. When I thought of Sofia I felt rage, but I knew it wasn’t my anger. 

“It’s funny,” Ragna chuckled, “I didn’t expect to find, dare I say, a friend?”

I scoffed, “Yeah well, I expect perks if I’m friends with the empress of the world, right?”

“Oh, is that how it is?” Ragna said, her smile growing.  

“Yes.  I want an island, at some point,” I joked.

Ragna laughed, “You’ll settle for armor for now,” she motioned for me to follow her.

…

I was standing in the Palace basement, and while Ragna had trained me with weighted clothing, it was strange to wear full plate armor.

I was like some kind of cosplayer at a renaissance fair. My hands flexed in the gauntlets, I noticed chainmail in between the joints.  Between me and the armor, I wore black stretchy fabric.  It was comfortable, though it bunched up around my neck.

Ragna interjected, “the chainmail is also Crystalinum,” she smiled, turning to a short woman with jet-black hair.

The woman was wearing a lab coat and had safety goggles on.  “Difficult to make, but not impossible!  Oh, the technology that Empress Ragna has imparted to us!”

I picked up the helmet and slid it on, finding it had difficultly with my long hair.

“I’m afraid you must cut it shorter Madison,” Ragna said, half a smile on her face.

“Well, no offense, but I am not shaving my head!” I objected.

Ragna slid her hand over the right side of her head, grinning, “Oh it’s so freeing Madison,” she chuckled.  I wondered if she braided the other side daily, as it was long but still thin towards the bottom.

I got the helmet on, though it was tight.  The helmet closed around the front of my mouth, my eyes the only thing exposed.  

As I moved it surprised me how light the armor was, either this was a feature of the metal or my newfound physique.  

Ragna gave me a mischievous smile, “Why don’t you walk over this way, Madison?”

I narrowed my eyes as she pointed to a firing range, “What are you up to?”

“A field test.”

I walked to where she pointed cautiously.  The armor did not inhibit my range of motion, though I would not be sneaking up on the enemy in any major way.

“Head downrange, Maddy,” Ragna stated.

“Sure thing Raggy,” I had to thank Rasper later, I felt like me again.

As I turned to Ragna, she had a strange look on her face.  She wasn’t mad at my nickname nor did she seem happy.  She was lost in thought again, and I wondered if this was another moment she might think about letting me closer to her.  Strange as it was, I don’t think I ever met someone as walled up as Ragna was.  She had my sympathy. 

“Sorry, that was-”

“No, I shouldn’t have,” Ragna smirked, “*Raggy…* is just… no.” 

“Do you have another preference?” I asked.

Ragna paused, deep in thought.  I wished I could step inside her head.  Then again, after recalling what Devon said he saw, that might not be a good idea.  Visions of dead angels danced in my head, and I wondered still if Ragna has massacred all of heaven or just a small part of it.

The woman in the lab coat walked over with a blast shield with something poking through it, “Ready your grace!”

“Good, Madison, say ‘activate visor’ please?” Ragna asked.

“Activate visor?” A blue haze came over everything.  It highlighted Ragna in green, as was the woman behind the blast shield.  “Looks like a video game,” I said as the visor highlighted the thing sticking through the blast shield in red.  “What’s that?”  

“Weapon hot!” The woman shouted.  

Ragna smiled, “Open fire.”

A hail of bullets flew out of the barrel of the gun in front of me.  I thought I would die.  They shot out so quickly I didn’t have time to react.  They struck my breastplate, and I staggered back a bit before I regained my footing.  Bullet holes riddled the firing range around me.  I checked my chest, there wasn’t a scratch on the armor.  

“D-Did you just shoot a machine gun at me?!” I shouted.

“Yes,” Ragna said with a sly grin.  “The visor is a force field, but it takes a lot to power, so only activate it during heavy fire.  The rest is some rather boring augmented reality.” 

I touched my chest plate, finding it cool, “Can I try something?”

Ragna smiled, “Open fire.”

This time I tried to trace the rounds.  It was difficult, but towards the end of the salvo, I blocked a stream of bullets with my wrists guards.  “Wonder Woman eat your heart out,” I said seeing some lead residue on the arm guards.

“Who?” Ragna asked.

“Oh, nothing,” I smiled, pulling the helmet off.  “All the soldiers are wearing this stuff?”

Ragna nodded, “if you pull the fabric around your neck up to your nose, you’ll find a filter that will protect from any form of gas, if you drink water through it, the fabric will act as a filter.  The battery for your visor charges kinetically, still it’s best to leave it off until you take heavy fire.”

“You thought of everything, huh?” I asked.

“Just about,” Ragna turned as I saw Esmerelda walking towards her, “Perfect timing.”

Esmerelda bowed, “Mistress, I have what you requested.”  Esmerelda offered a sword.

The blade looked rough, the edges were jagged like cut glass, the entire length black. Steam slid off the surface.

Eris’s voice was back again, “oh my what… is that lovely thing?”

Eris floating over my shoulder startled me, “finished with Eurybia?”

Esmerelda responded to Eris, to my shock, “a blade forged of chaos energy, Spirit of Discord.” 

“Oh, please call me Eris you slut-on-steroids,” Eris spat, “gimmie gimmie gimmie!”

Esmerelda turned to Ragna, “My mistress, are you certain about… *her*?” 

Ragna nodded, “Yes,” she turned to me, offering the sword’s handle.  “Two qualities of this sword make it unique. Care to explain, Esmerelda?”

Eris’s eyes were wide as saucers as I took the blade in my hand.  “Oh, I must…” she touched the blade, it’s blade changed to white and gold, the steam now yellow as a result, “ooooh that’s the good stuff!” Eris tittered and cooed as if she was getting high off a drug.

Esmerelda rolled her eyes, “Anyone struck by this blade will suffer a bout of chaos. They will lose their minds.  If you plunge this blade into the heart of an angel, it can kill them.  No need to remove their wings.”

I looked to Ragna, “Wait, why would I need that?”

“Captain Sofia Vázquez is an Angel, a Nephilim, but still an Angel.  She’s an Avatar of Samael.”

Eris’s eyes went wide and she recoiled from the sword, “Samael...” she whispered in fear.

I frowned, “What is Samael?”

Eris slinked to my other shoulder, “The Venom of God,” she hissed.  

“A powerful angel of God, but there’s a weakness,” Ragna pointed out, “Sofia is a Terran to start, and her mind is weak and blind.  While I’m sure Samael has pushed her to the brink of madness, a strike from this could force her over the edge.”

I nodded, looking at the sword in my hand, “So, use this to kill her or drive her insane then?”

“Correct,” Ragna stated.

“When do I get the chance to kill her?” 

“Patience, Captain.”  Ragna began, “Our first target will be the softest one, Caracas.  Killing their head of state will be up to you.” 

“Can’t we just imprison them?  Must we kill them?”

“This man has little redemption in him Madison, but I'll leave it to your discretion.  Imprison him, or kill him, either way, we remove him from power and take the country,” Ragna advised.

I sheathed the sword, getting a feel for the armor, “mind if I wear this home?”

Ragna smiled, “go ahead.”

…

If I didn’t turn heads before, I was turning them now.  I heard whispers and got the occasional accusatory glance.  

I should mention, on the back of my armor was a symbol of Eris.  A Discordian regimen was unheard of.

When I got home, I caught Hilly on her way out, she was in her red royal guard uniform.  She gave me a hungry gaze, “Wow, aren’t we a pair?”

I closed the door behind me.  I did not understand how to face Hilly now, even with my emotions sorted out.  Rasper was right, my feelings for Hilly were amplified.  My heart was hammering in my chest and I couldn’t believe what I had done the night before.

“Maddy?”

“Huh?” I turned to see her coming in for a kiss.

I stopped her “I’m sorry if I was… fast, before,” I blushed, “things got mixed up in my head and-” 

She placed her finger to my lips.  “It’s fine,” she grinned, “I will not lie, I kind of enjoyed you being forceful.  Maybe something we could play with later?  I just, well, I didn’t want you to be all anger.” 

I tried to change the subject, “So, where are you off to?”

Hilly sighed, “Well, The Queen wants her wedding tomorrow.”

“Tomorrow? She could barely walk yesterday!”

“Well,” Hilly began, “tomorrow is when she wants it.” 

“Talk about demanding,” I looked to the door, wondering if Hilly would leave soon.  I hadn’t felt this conflicted since the day after she raped me.  That thought sent me for a loop, to say the least, and I felt sick. 

“Want to meet me there tomorrow?  I’ll make sure you have a ticket,” Hilly said as she stood at the door.

“Sure,” I forced a smile, “we can meet up.”

“Well, I’ll be back later, so you can wait for dinner. Oh,” she blushed, “I guess you’re not my Hestie anymore.”

“I haven’t forgotten how to cook,” I reminded.

“Okay,” Hilly beamed.

Her smile was so adorable, “Love you.” I said before I could stop myself.  My stomach was in my feet and I slapped my hand over my mouth.  Damn you Rasper!

“I,” Hilly’s cheeks darkened, “l-love you too, Maddy.”  

She lingered in the doorway.

“I-I’m sorry that just…” my cheeks were burning, “slipped out.”

Hilly’s cheeks were just as red, “I’ll see you later?”

“Later,” I promised.

Hilly left and I swallowed the lump in my throat, “just tossing out the ‘I love you’ whenever…” I scolded myself.  I gave my forehead a good thunk, “Damn it.” 

The house phone rang, I picked it up, “hello?”

“Madison,” the word almost sounded like a soldier in my head as Ragna said it. .

“Oh, Ragna, hi,” I wasn’t sure how I should address her.

“I will assume you heard about the wedding tomorrow?” She asked.

“Yes,” I confirmed.

“Good.  Rachel is insistent we wed as soon as possible so, that’s the current situation.”

“So it would seem,” I was curious where this was going, “Ragna, why are you calling?”

There was a moment of silence, “it’s customary for a wedding to include more than just a bride and a groom, there’s a wedding party of sorts, from what I gather.”

“Yeah” I humored her, “The ladies have a bridal party with a maid of honor and the men have a ‘best man’ with their groomsmen.”

“Yes, that is what I understand.  There’s no formal ceremony here in Penthesil, Rachel’s been demanding we follow the tradition you described,” Ragna continued.

“Are you getting cold feet or something?” I asked.

“No!” Ragna defended, “I want to marry Rachel more than anything.”

“You just sound nervous,” I pointed out.

Ragna paused for some time, “It’s an aspect of the wedding I am unsure of.”

“What’s that?”

“I don’t have,” Ragna paused again, “what was it you said, a ‘Best Man’, or a ‘Best Woman’ in this case.”

“I’ve seen weddings where the groom is alone,” I thought of the last time I had seen such a thing.  My uncle got married alone, granted his bride was 30 years his junior. 

“As it stands the parties are lopsided.  Rachel has requested Launa as her Maid of Honor,” Ragna continued.

“That’s nice!  I’m happy that those two are still friends,” I wondered if Launa would get into a bridesmaid’s dress.  

Ragna was silent for another moment or two, “Be my ‘Best woman’?”

It shocked me, “I… what?”

“Would You Be My Best Woman?” Ragna asked again.

I stared at the wall flabbergasted.

“Madison?” Ragna asked, “Did I lose you?”

“N-no! No, just, I… I’m stunned is all,” I managed, “I mean-”

“You’re the only friend I have, who’s a woman.  I could ask Syria or Alexis but they’re servants,” Ragna’s pause seemed to have something snapping in the background, “You are not.”

“I’ll… sure, yes, I can be your woman of honor,” I answered.

Ragna’s voice shifted and I could hear the relief wash over her, “Thank you.”

“Was I your first choice?” I said smiling over the phone.

“Madison,” Ragna assured, “You’re my only choice.

…

I’ve been a bridesmaid once before.  I’ve not been a ‘best woman’ before.  I wore

ceremonial armor rather than a tux.  Ragna and I stood at the steps of the throne, the nun, Sister Catherine, or Fatima, whichever she was going by today, stood behind us.  

Ragna was wearing something like her normal armor, polished to a high sheen and her cape was silver rather than blue.  Despite the occasion, Ragna wore no make-up.

Ragna leaned over to me, “You have the ring, yes?”

I nodded, motioning to a box in my hand, “guarding it with my life.”

Ragna nodded.

“Nervous?” I asked.

“Excited,” Ragna said. “I haven’t seen Rachel since the treatment. She demanded it.” 

“Treatment?” I asked.

Music started to play as Launa made her way down the aisle, which was in the middle of the royal court.  She wore a lovely silver dress that showed off her curves well.  It surprised me, as most bridesmaid’s dresses seem like attempts to make the bridesmaids seem as homely as possible when compared to the bride.

Launa took her place and waved at me. 

I waved back before louder music began.  I turned my attention to the front of the room as Rachel made her way towards us.

She looked ten years younger, if not more.  I thought it was make-up but as she strode towards us in time with the music it was clear something had changed.  Rachel’s wings were bright silver now, shimmering as if they were metallic.  

The dress she wore was white with intricate silver lines woven into the veil and fabric. The dress was strapless and backless, with a long train behind her.  She wasn’t carrying any flowers, but walked confidently up to the steps, taking Ragna’s offered hand.

Ragna removed the veil, and that’s when I noticed the biggest change in Rachel.  

Rachel’s eyes were glowing blue now, her iris’s acting like pulsing LED lights.  Nothing about her eyes seemed organic, as if her eyes were replaced with some kind of false eye.  Yet they still focused, shifted, and moved like real eyes.

My stomach dropped, and I was more than a bit disturbed.  What had ‘The Treatment’ done?  How extreme was it?  Ragna had no qualms about forcing her emotions into me, yet she was apprehensive about this treatment.

Ragna’s hand caressed her cheek, “how are you feeling?”

“Flawless,” Rachel said, smiling.  

I noticed the silver parts of her dress were moving within the fabric, shifting and sliding back and forth, almost like trails of silver sand in motion.  Was this the dress, or the treatment?

Rachel grinned, “today, a wedding, tomorrow, a war.”

Ragna nodded, turning to Sister Fatima, “you can begin, Fatima.” 

Weddings are dull, this was no exception.  Though the kiss between them was deep and passionate.  I couldn’t help but smile when they finally got to that part.  The court erupted in applause, but I could tell neither of them could hear any of us.  They were lost in each other’s embrace, and I had to admit, despite Rachel’s changes, it was beautiful.

Launa was in tears, the happy sort.

…

Hilly joined me at the wedding party table, Ragna and Rachel were dancing after all the speeches.  “Busy day?” Hilly asked.

I nodded, drinking another glass of sparkling cider, “Yeah.”  

“How did you get in this good with the Empress?” she asked.

I chuckled, “Training.” 

Off to the side, I saw Sister Fatima speaking to that Syria woman. 

“Those two close?” I asked.

Hilly looked at the pair, they were out of sight from most, “Maybe?”

Syria got down on one knee.

“Oh,” Hilly said, eyes wide.

I couldn’t help but smile, “I guess so.”

Syria slid a ring onto Sister Fatima’s finger, and the pair embraced.  

“Love’s in the air,” I said.

Hilly laughed.

I turned to Hilly, “So, between the two of us...”

Hilly blushed, looking to the dance floor, “I don’t think we need anything formal, do you?”

I shook my head, “I’d like… to start over.”

“Me too,” Hilly kept her eyes on the dance floor.  “As much as I asked you before I never thought you’d say ‘yes’.  The ‘I love you’ was,” she turned to me, “I thought about Maria a lot today.”

“Yesterday must have been a complete blind-side,” I sighed.

Hilly grinned, “a little, but it was a welcome surprise.”

I wasn’t sure where to go from there, but my heart was aching for what I had planned to say next, “Tomorrow is the start of a war.”

“Don’t think about it,” Hilly suggested.

“I kind of have to,” I looked to her, “I might not come back.”

HIlly’s face fell.

“If that’s the case, I don’t know if starting something new with you is fair,” my heart sank.

HIlly faced me, “Maddy if you don’t come back, I don’t want to live with regret.” She took my hand, “You want to start over, right?”

I looked up to her, and her sweet pleading eyes.  Oh God, my heart!  The look on her face just took hold of me.  “Yes.”

“Then let's go home together, and see what happens?”

When we got home, we talked for hours about everything and anything.  Hilly fell asleep on me, and I couldn’t sleep for a single second.  I cradled her against me staring at the ceiling, wondering what war was like, what to expect.  Would I come home?  What would Hilly do if I didn’t?  I looked to her sleeping face, and she looked so innocent.  Hate me if you want, but damn it, I love this woman.  ‘Enhanced’ emotion or not, I was coming home to her, and I didn’t care who I crushed on the way.

I forgave her that morning for what she did to me those years ago.  After all, we're starting over, right?

…

I stood before a group of thirty soldiers, all Discordian.

Eurybia held a large banner of the golden apple of Eris up by a metal post above us.  Eurybia was clad in golden armor.  Her helmet covered her face down to her nose, leaving only one slit for her eye, exposing her cheek. The other half of the helm looked broken, exposing her eye.  Every part of the armor’s designs, from the style of gauntlets to the boots were asymmetrical.   

The rest of us wore our jet-black armor.  I had a gun on my back, my sword at my side.

Eurybia grinned, “I’m so happy to be marching with you!” Eurybia was downright giddy.

“I’ll watch your back, don’t worry,” I assured.

The Discordians were the vanguard, to our right was a couple of hundred soldiers.

Ragna stood before all of us in her fighting armor, her wings hidden behind her cape.

Rachel landed next to Ragna. Her silver wings folded or rather melted into her back, covering her body in silver armor that seemed to shift and move like a fluid.  Rachel’s mere appearance made me apprehensive, I was unsure of what she was anymore.  She turned to Ragna.

Ragna shouted, “We march against a government that has starved their people, lied to them, and shot them in the street like dogs!”

The army booed and hissed.

“We will march to the capitol, and strike at the heart of their government,” Ragna looked to me.

Ragna commanded, “those who stand for this government are evil men who enjoy the corruption sown by their leader!  Show them no mercy!” 

The soldiers all gave hoots and powerful shouts of approval.

“This is the first of many nations who will fall, and rise greater than they ever could before!” Ragna shouted.  Ragna turned to me, “At your command captain.” 

Esmerelda stood before us, opening a portal to a city.  I was shaking inside as I glanced to my regimen.  Eurybia had suggested the name of our unit, and with the black armor, I thought it was fitting: The Daughters of Darkness. 

The goal is chaos, discord, and conquest.  I’m only targeting guys with guns and those in the government.  So if you’re there, don’t go into work today, and if you’re in power, hide or give it up!

We’re coming for you.  So don’t resist!  Or else you will see what happens when you force us to get violent.

The real life counterpart to the SCP Foundation,"My name is John, John Burkes. You might know me from my son's story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dacy7x/my_childhood_imaginary_friend_came_back_and_he/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), and if you're wondering, yes I'm dead. I *am* a doctor, not on Alzheimers though, as my son thought. I'm a scientist on the real life counterpart of the SCP Foundation.  I used the ""Dr."" title to trick people into thinking I'm a doctor. I'm glad my son is finally at peace. He figured it out himself! Now it's *my* turn. 

I've been stuck here for longer than I lived as a physical being. Last time I counted I was here for 1,450 days. I don't age, but the agency does. By agency I mean the ""SCP Foundation."" Here it't name is the *""最も暗い秘密"" (Mottomo kurai himitsu)* which means, the darkest secrets. Pretty unoriginal huh? Well to be fair this is all in ***""My"" World.*** Like Carlton, this is all fake. In my ""imagination"" or maybe it's Satan's playhouse. I did this containment breach just so I could see what will happen. If a huge facility like that lose power, you'd think it would have a good protocol. I destroyed it all. I can't seem to find peace and move on with Carlton. Anyways back to the experience...



It has been a week or so now, no one in sight. Also a strange think I've taken note of is no **""specimens""** in sight. It's strange but I'm not complaining. As I move on towards the end of the hall, *drip drip drip* a skinwalker. It was right in front of me. I forgot we had these damn things in here. We made sure they were blind ; they can only hear and feel. It was for saftey protocols and so we could ""test"" on them easier. 

I had 2 options, *run to the other end of the hall, hence getting further from the ""exit""* or *stay completely still.* The fuck did I choose? I *ran,* as fast as I can. I was nearing the end of the hall till I hear giggling. Pretty fucking creepy. Whatever it was though, it wasn't a bad creature. It was a little girl. She was smiling and was following me, matching my pace. Whilst all this, the damn skinwalker was accelerating. I asked, ""can you get that damn thing away from me?"" I knew this ""specimen"" was one of the good ones so I gave it a shot. She just nodded and turned into a fucking spider. Yes, you heard me, ***A FUCKING SPIDER.*** She killed the skinwalker in a flash, then turned back into the cute little girl. 

I asked her if she wanted anything in return, she just *hugged* me? In this akward ass situation I'm in I just hugged back. Then she just disappeared into thin air. What thw fuck is up with the creatures here, I swear. 

*(Transition to after an hour or so)..*
As I'm nearing the exit, I come across a hallway that splits into 2 ways. One saying ""Exit"" and the other to ""Specimen 001 ---&gt;"". The answer was easy of course to the exit. The longer I walked deeper into the Exit route, blood. *Blood* was everywhere. Smeared on the walls. Then the intercom (the fuck?) turned on. ***""I see that you made it far. You're close to the end. You'll meet your boy sooner or later. Just a little test though...""***

Follwed that demonic ass screams behind me. Yep, demonic ***FUCKING*** screams behind me. I bolted my ass to the exit. Yet the exit was no where to be found. I shouted *""God damnit Satan the fuck do you want?""* 

*""I wanna see you die duh.""* That damn Lucifer replied.

*""What happens if I die?""* I responded while trying to gasp for air (even if (for some reason) I wasn't tired).

*""I don't really know actually.""* Lucifer said mockingly.

*""Fine I'll see what the demon (probably) thing looks like.""* I said as I stopped running.

What followed was the little cute girl from a while ago. She just gave me a hug. *""YOU HAPPY NOW?""* I shouted.

*""Well, uhhhh that wasn't what I expected. Well you're free now see that Carlton boy of yours I guess.""* Satan replied with a embarassed (who knew Satan would get embarassed) tone in his voice.

Then out of no where the door just appeared. To some ""heavenly"" place. That's where I'm typing this. My son Carlton whom I haven't seen in years oh I miss him. I still don't know causing chaos in the facili— **OH.** He just wanted to see me do evil damn you. Well looks like I'm going to hell soon. I think for now I'll ask if I could wait for Charlotte and Charlie. I hope they read this as well."
Where to begin,"Adrenaline. Adrenaline and fear. Fear? I'm not even sure I understand that word anymore. I'm not even sure I find this line of work satisfying, or if I ever did, i just stumbled upon it. A calling you could say, or fate, destiny, honestly anything. 

After what feels like a lifetime of doing this, but only around 3 years, I felt like I should start chronicling my work. I'm not sure if anyone will read this, and if they do, whether they'll choose to believe, or call me a madman. To be honest I'm not phased either way.

Right now I'm standing in front of what was once a young vampire.... relatively speaking. He put up one hell of a fight, I'll be feeling a bit worse for wear tomorrow, but at least I've dealt with the issue. Not the way I like to deal with issues like this, but sometimes you just have to pray and spray the stake minigun.

To explain why I just littered an alleyway with blessed splinters, I guess I need to delve back a little bit, 4 years ago, when I felt much younger.

I was out on a midnight stroll, it was quite warm if I'm honest, full moon was out and I just had a compulsion to leave the house in my work gear, and walk the park. I'd normally walk this route after work daily, I was an electrician so I always had some pliers, screwdrivers and at least 14 different tiny things that no doubt would ruin my washing machine later that night.

I rounded the corner near the local 24/7 emergency room, it was pretty quiet, it was a wednesday after all. There wasnt much sound, the birds had gone to sleep, the occasional cricket chirped happily enough, and if I really strained my ears I could hear morepork in the forest not far from here. Strangely enough I could also hear some kind of growling/ whimpering towards the centre of the park. Being in a relatively low crime area with plenty of lights around I headed in, figured I'd help out a dog in need if I could.

As I rounded the Bush line that breaks the dog walking tracks from the incredibly maintained gardens I saw something that made me think I must have been having one hell of a lucid dream. It was a man, a man I knew. Not a best friend or anything, fellow tradie. He was a plumber, Jack was his name. I rushed over to him and quickly dropped to the grass, it was already wet with overnight dew.

He wasnt bleeding, no bruising or anything. 

""Jack mate, what the hell happened?""

Expecting a brief story about how he had a fight with his housemate and ended up drunk in the park, so when he turned to face me, seeing his eyes, usually a light blue, a deep amber, kind of made me double take a little bit.

""Run you dumbass!"" 

Ever the poet there, Jack.

I stood up, and said a few words I never really thought I would say.

""You're a werewolf? Holy shit dude!"" I was metaphorically shitting myself, thinking what the hell I could do to help him and or stop him eating the hobos around the ER.

I did something a little part of me had wanted to do since he cut some of my cables as a prank, took me 2 days to fix that fuck up, serves me right for putting a screw into his hot water pipes i suppose 🤣. I took a step back and with a nice size 10 steel capped boot, threw my weight behind a kick straight to his jaw, assuming it would either knock him out, kill him or stop him transforming.

Well it did neither, and I can assure you, a half transformed werewolf that's just been kicked in the jaw is not exactly the best recipe for a wonderfully calm evening.

The next part is where I lost track. Jack, now 8 feet tall, covered in dark fur, generic werewolf look about him, lifted me off the ground in a tackle that would make most rugby players recieve a red card, instead he drove me into the ground. I thought I was going to die right then, I couldn't breathe, stars in front of my eyes. As quickly as it started though, he stopped. Eyes wide open, no sound coming out of his mouth. 

Turns out werewolves are weak to silver, but not in the traditional sense. Itll strip them of their aggression and urge to kill almost anything (rabbits beware).

He rolled off me, unconcious and completely naked, now human again. I fireman carried his naked ass back to my place and put him on the couch. Dont ask me why I kept the solid silver screwdriver my boss gave me as a congratulations for becoming qualified, but I'm bloody glad I did.

I dont have much time left, I can hear the police sirens now, and I dont exactly want to be seen with a splinter mini gun in a dark alley on a Wednesday night, people might start thinking I'm weird.

I'll fill you in on how I got to here and what my next mission is shortly, but for now stay safe, stay smart and by god, if you're in a crowded bar and hear your name being called, keep your head down. You'll thank me later."

I have one job. And I’m very good at it.,"I have one job. And I’m very good at it. 

There are *monsters* that linger on the periphery of our society. Monsters that thrive off of chaos. From literal monsters that threaten the safety of the world to hungry children stealing food from local grocers. The circumstances never matter to me. In every instance, I act the same. If you break the rules, you are a monster. And monsters must be hunted.

My name is Tom Lelaps. I hunt monsters. I *exist* for this one reason; this one purpose.

Someone once compared what I do to that of a *guardian angel*. But they were wrong. Someone else once called me a *monster*. But they were wrong, too. I have no desire to hurt you. I have no desire to protect you. *Intent* is not in my vocabulary. I have but one function. One rule. And one must never break the rules.

Which brings us to my current target: Father Jerry Cadmean

Father Cadmean is a priest who’s killed dozens of people in the past 6 years. His killings have always been sporadic and brutal. He seemed to pick his victims on a whim, without rhyme or reason. Which is why the officers who worked his murders could never pick up a trend.  He’s one of the world’s most prolific serial killers, and yet no one even knows he exists. 

But I knew. He had popped up on my radar around 5 years ago. And I’ve been hunting him down ever since. 

He did have a knack for staying off the grid, however. Thus, why our game of cat and mouse has lasted as long as it has. But as I said before, I do my job very well. So it was always going to end this way. 

When I discovered Father Cadmean had been hospitalized at a small community hospital in rural Louisiana, I dropped everything and rushed here immediately. I knew he never stayed in one place for long and he had slipped through my fingers before. 

When I arrived, I found a fragile Father Cadmean, still in his religious **habit**, unconscious and on a ventilator in the ICU. He’s here now and is the only patient in the unit. His story prior to admission is still unknown.

His doctor, a Dr. Tim Essien, is an older, stoic gentleman, who rarely left Father Cadmean’s bedside. He’s informed me of Cadmean’s poor prognosis, stating that his organs had shut down and that his condition is slowly becoming unstable. 

Per Dr. Essien, no one has been able to slow the rapid progression of Cadmean’s symptoms and that, in his medical opinion, he doesn’t think Cadmean will survive the night. 

His words triggered feelings of satisfaction and completeness. *The serial killer had been stopped. His death was practically a guarantee*. I studied the priest’s motionless silhouette for a moment. *My job was done. And it was done well.* 

My eyes then land on Cadmean’s nightstand. Atop of which lied what appeared to be a journal. Silver letters were scribbled on the outside fold. They read: ***Not all those who wander are lost***

I flip through the pages and find myself reading a morbid auto-biography of Father Cadmean’s life. It, alone, is shocking enough, but it was only after I finished reading did I perceive an even scarier truth in within these pages.

I’ve decided to post a few excerpts from the journal here. In a place where people believe the unbelievable. So if anything in this journal sparks something in your memory, anything you’ve maybe seen in the news, you should tell me. 

Because I have only one job. I can *do* only one thing. And, if what this journal is suggesting is true, then that job is not yet finished.

Today in confession, I met a man who wasn’t there. 

I didn’t see him walk in, but I could somehow make out his silhouette in the darkness. That and his smirk. But absolutely nothing else. Not the rest of his face. Not the waLl between us. Not even my own hands held out in front of me. It’s like nothing else in the universe existed. Nothing except for me, this man, and his smirk.

“Bless me father, for I have sinned,” he finally said. His low pitched voice seemed to vibrate the darkness itself. I carefully responded; asked him when he’d last had confession. He simply replied, “Feels like an eternity ago.”

We chatted for a bit, but for the life of me I can’t seem to remember exactly what was said. Something about free will? Or rules? I’m not sure. All I remember from the chat was that it was incredibly *thrilling*. 

I left my side of the confessional and stood oUtside of his stall, wanting to embrace the stranger. I was the one tasked to offer penance yet I was the one who’d left that dialogue feeling *enlightened* and so filled with… *puRpose*.

But he never came out and I never saw him leave. I pushed his curtain to the side. It was empty. 

I would’ve sworn I’d met a man today. But that man wasn’t there.

**19MAR2014@ 06:33**

Do you think we get what we desErve?

Yesterday in confessional, I counseled a married, middle aged overweight gentleman who apparently enjoyed showering himself in cheap cologne. He was a curt and unruly gentleman and, for some reason, just his presence made me feel ill.

“Forgive me faTher, for I have sinned.”

It isn’t fair to completely blame this fellow for the way I was feeling. I’ve felt progressively uncomfortable inside my own skin ever since I met that other gentleman last year. The one that wasn’t there.

“Confess your sins, my son, so that I may grant you peace,” I offered in a warm, but practiced tone. 

“Recently, I met this fine piece of as-,”

“Language, my son. We’re in the house of the L0rd.”

“My apologies, Father. So I met this young woman the other day. And we’ve made an arrangement. She’s agreed to be my *friend*. And I agreed to pay for her schooling.”

“Are you confessing to both adultery and soliciting a prostitute, my son?” 

“No Father, this is different. We’re just *friends with benefits*. It’s a thing. I’ve also been getting her to do *other* things, too. You’d be surprised how much people will do for cash. I’ve actually given her a list of *rules* to follow. Want to hear about it?”

For soMe reason, my body shuddered at the mention of the word *rule*. 

He went on for some time detailing all the gruesome and disgusting acts he’d have this *friend with benefits* perform. I nearly lost my lunch. 

Usually I would have ended the session there and encouraged the fellow to seek psychiatric counseling. However, this time I found myself opting for a different route. 

I didn’t interrupt or comment, I just quietly listened to every disgusting detail. And, after he finisHed, I completed the atonement and politely ushered the gentleman out of the church. Before he left, I made sure to acquire his contact information for the church’s community service project next month. 

If he had come to church more often, he’d have known that that project was actually last month. 

.

I didn’t mEan to kill him. It sort of just happened. 

When I’d arrived at his home yesterday evening, I had thought no one would be home. In confession, he’d stated his wife was out of town and that he’d be out running errands for the rest of the day. 

But, casually lying on the floor in the living room, was a young woman dressed in minimal clothing and covered in bruises. At first, I thought she was unconscious as there were empty bottles of alcohol surrounding her. It wasn’t until I checked for a pulse did I realize that that wasn’t the case.

Ok, so maybe I did mean to kill him. 

Armed with a serRated knife I found in the kitchen, I hid in one of the shadows. My dark habit garments aided in my camouflage within the darkness. 

I heard him enter the house. As I expected, he’d walked straight past the living room with the dead body, and went to the kitchen, straight to the fridge. As he opened the door of the fridge, my body practically moved on its own. 

I left the shadows for the briEfest of moments, and, in one swift motion, brought the blade to his jugular with an almost practiced efficiency. As streams of blood pulsated across the kitchen it mixed in with the entering moonlight, casting a lovely crimson tint over the room. I took in the sight and then disappeared back into the shadows.

As I made my way back to the church, I waited for remorse or regret to hit me, but it never came. It still hasn’t. But I do feel something else brewing. Something deep inside of my being starting to bubble itself to the surface. Something that I’ve never felt before. The best way I can describe it is that it feels liKe ‘coming home for the first time’. 

I made it to the church’s front entrance, but before I entered, I looked up at the stars. 

I had an overwhelming feeling that all of this -- all of us here, every star, and every planet; it's all for nothing. Our lives are just commercials, playing inside a theater for an audience that was never there. 

Whatever I previously thought had defined me was just a story I’d been telling myself. If God did exist, He wouldn't care if I was a priest, an adulterer…

Or even a murderer. 

The man I was before was no longer there. No longer a man of the cloth. I was free. Free to become anything else. Free to fInd a new purpose. A new meaning to this meaningless existence we call life. 

I have 4 people scheduled for confession tomorrow. I wondered if this question afflicted the deepest parts of them as well.  

I’ll be sure to check.

**08SEPT2017 @ 10:00**

The church burned down today. 

I’ve taken confessional for aLmost a decade now. I have seen enough guilt and shame and pain and lust and loneliness in that damned confessional booth to last me a dozen lifetimes. I've learned that many lost souls aimLessly wander this Earth. All searching for answers that’ll never come. All seeking a purpose they may never find. 

The church burned down today. 

Since the dawn of man, humanity has been searching for the answer to that one single unchanging quesTion: *what is my purpose?* I have a luxury that most do not. Because you see, thanks to the man that wasn’t there all those years ago, I now *know* my purpose. 

The church burned down today.

I have seen the worst of humanity. I have experienced true misery. And I’ve learned that misery is bred from bondage. It’s simple biology. Inside the walls of a closed off system, chaos will ensue. But what would happen if one would tear down those walls? What would we do then?? How would we use our freshly minted freedOM!?

The church burned down today. 

This will be my last entry. Whoever finds this journal, I hope you, too, find your purpose. And I hope that it satisfies you. Because if you do find that purpose, and you discover that it isn’t as gratifying or as fulfilling, as mine is…

..then I expect I’ll be seeing you shortly.

The church burned down today. 

Such a shame, really.

\---

So you see. This monster had a partner. Or a mentor maybe? Some man he mentioned in the beginning. Someone who looks to have started ALL of this. 

I had wanted to ask Dr. Essien if he had any information about how Father Cadmean had come in to the hospital, hoping it would maybe give me a lead on this ‘*man who wasn’t there*’, but I couldn’t find him. Would’ve sworn he was just at Cadmean’s bedside. But he wasn’t there when I looked a second ago. 

So all that’s left is you guys. All of Father Cadmean’s killings occurred in Southern Louisiana. If you have any information about these killings or about the *‘man that wasn’t there’*, anything at all, let me know through here. Please! I have only this one job. I can *do* only this one thing. Help me hunt this guy down. 

\---

EDIT: Father Cadmean missing! After I finished typing this, I’d went back to check on him, but he wasn’t there! His bed was empty! I rushed back to the nursing station to report him missing, but they report never even having a patient named Father Cadmean. In fact, they say that that wing of the hospital has been shut down for some time. 

Did he get better? Was he ever even sick? Why would he set all this up?

I’m not sure what’s going on, but I got a bad feeling about all of this. 

Someone… ANY one… please…

Help me…"
