The Shadow Man

	So tis the season and what not. I know Spooptober is coming to an end but it's halloween and I can't sleep so I thought why not actually post a true story from my childhood! Now being that all of this happened around the time I was 5 or so years old the memories are pretty foggy so most of this is just things I was told by my dad, brother, mom, and uncle. Let's get to it shall we?
	
	I've always had a super active imagination. Even to this day my imagination just runs wild which is why I love to write and draw. I get to pour all of that raw emotion and imagination onto paper or online. It was a little more different when I was a kid. I didn't exactly have many friends when I was young. Well I actually didn't have ANY friends growing up. At school I was this really quiet and shy kid who never tried to interact with anyone except my teacher. I would always get notes sent home about how I was so smart and did so well on all my work but really needed help on socalizing with the other kids. My dad thought this was insane. Me? Quiet? At home I was a wild child. Drawing on walls, running through the house screaming, throwing my toys all over rhe place, crashing my brothers big trucks into anything and everything. I was also known for having a lot of imaginary friends. Such as my "boyfriend" Charlie who was made out of solid gold and had diamonds in his hair. A lot of times if I wasn't running a muck I could be seen talking to various walls in the the house.
	
	I always had a lot of "friends" at home. Such as the purple "mon-ser" that lived in our trashcan and loved carrots or the tall man in our backyard who smelled like smoke and had a funny accent. My dad never thought anything of is. I was just a weird kid with an active imagination. That is until one day when I saw the Shadow Man. My parents had been legally seperated before I was even born. They had a real rocky relationship and while my mom didn't live with us my dad would still let her see us on occasion. One day we went to pick up my mom from the house she was staying at. I was sitting in the back in my carseat while my older brother was in the front. While we were waiting for my mom to come out I suddenly asked, "Who's that, daddy?" My dad looked to the house in confusion. "Who's who, baby?"
	
	"That!" I said while pointing out the window at seemingly nothing. "She's talking about the man in the doorway." My brother chimed in making my dad freeze. It was one thing for me to see something that wasn't there but the fact that both of his kids were seeing someone he wasn't was far more concerning. "What man?"
	
	"The tall man." I called still pointing out the window. "He's all dark, it's hard to see what he looks like." Just as my brother said that my mom walked out the door and we dropped rhe subject. Everything was normal for a while after that until about a week later. It was late, my brother and I were out cold while my dad and uncle hung out in the living room watching tv. That's when they heard something rather strange. Now our house was rather small. We had the livingroom which led to the kitchen and computer room. From the computer room you could get to mine and my brothers room which was also next to the kitchen. There was a short hallway from the livingroom that led to my dads bedroom and a backdoor in the kitchen that opened to the backyard. That was supposed to be it. No attic. Not basement. No weird crawl spaces. Nothing like that. But what my uncle and dad heard that night sounded like very slow and very heavy boot steps coming from above their heads, like in an attic.
	
	They turned off the tv and listened for a moment as the heavy boot steps continued. After they turned off the tv it also sounded like something was being pushed or dragged. The followed the sound as it went from above their heads in the livingroom, through the kitchen, to right above me and my brothers bed where it stopped. My dad and uncle rushed outside with a gun and two flashlights thinking maybe someone was on our roof but nothing. They also knew that wouldn't explain the pushing or dragging sound they heard but they couldn't think of any other explanation. To our knowledge we didn't have any kind of attic. This went on for a couple of nights and every morning I would be a lot quieter than normal. I started becoming very nervous at home. Before I'd have no problem sitting in my room on my own playing but now I was always attatched to someone. I'd follow my dad around the house or annoy my brother to play with me or cling to my uncle. I didn't even want to go to the bathroom on my own.
	
	I wasn't the only one acting strange. My brother was becoming more recluse as well. The boy who used to love playing videogames or watching tv with my dad and uncle now wanted to sit alone in our room. There were times my dad swore he could hear my brother having conversations with seemingly no one which, while it wasn't strange for me, it wasn't something my brother did. It all became overwhelming when one night I ran into my dads room in tears. I didn't cry much as a kid. Not when I'd burn my hand, or scrape my knee, or cut my forehead running into the edge of a counter. It took a lot to make me cry, usually I had to be really scared or really angry to cry, and here I was in the middle of the night bawling my eyes out and trembling. "Hey, hey, calm down. It's alright. What happened?" My dad asked thinking my brother had done something to scare me like he normally did. "I don't wanna sleep in my room anymore! The shadow man scares me!" My dad shot up in bed and quickly wiped the tears from my face. "What do you mean, baby?"
	
	"The shadow man! He stands next to our bed and stares at me and whispers things!" My dad wanted to believe this was just another case of my over active imagination. He wanted to believe this was something he could just explain away and make me feel better. "Are you sure you didn't just have a bad dream?" I shook my head as my crying reduced to sniffling and hiccups. "No! It's the tall man we saw at mamas house. He came home with us and I don't like him. He scares me and says mean things!" My dads heart sank when I brought up the man my brother and I had seen at my moms place not long ago. "What kinda things does he say to you?" I shook my head refusing to repeat anything the shadow man whispered to me and just begged my dad to let me sleep with him that night. He did, though he didn't get much sleep. It wasn't that my dad didn't believe in ghosts or spirits or whatever, he did, but he always wanted to come up with logical explanations for things. Every thing that happened wasn't really something he could reasonably explain though. If this was real how what was he supposed to do? He had two young kids to protect but how can you protect someone from a threat you can't see, hear, or touch?
	
	After a few nights of me running into my dads room in the middle of the night crying about the shadow man it stopped. He thought maybe it was starting to just blow over and the problem would handle itself until he started waking up covered in scratches. Now this wasn't a nightly thing the only time he'd wake up with scratches is if he yelled at my brother for doing something wrong. Whether it was not doing something when he was told, breaking a rule, or even hurting me my dad would always wake up the next morning covered in random scratches. He still didn't know what to do. I was still terrified to be anywhere on my own, my brother was still being very reclusive, and now he was waking up with scratches from yelling at his own child for misbehaving. My dad was at his wits end!
	
	Everything came to an end when my dad heard bootsteps again one night. He was up late watching tv unable to sleep when those familiar bootsteps started up again but this time they weren't above his head they were in the house. My dad jumped up from the couch and looked around but couldn't see any intruder. He knew where those bootsteps were going though. Quickly he dashed through the computer room, through our bedroom, and blocked the doorway from the kitchen to our room.
	
	Now I don't remember anything happening that night and neither does my brother. All I remember is waking up the next morning and getting ready for school only to see my uncle sitting in the livingroom waiting for us. "Where's daddy? He's gotta take us to school." My uncle picked me up in his arms with an almost pained look. "I'm takin y'all to school today?" My brother and I both looked at him in confusion. "Why? Where's dad?" My unlce explained that our dad wouldn't be taking us to school that or picking us up because he was in the hospital. When we asked what happened my uncle didn't really respond. He simply shook his head and got us in the car.

	Up, across… just, bring it around…
	
	Okay, now just drag it a little to the left…
	
	Maybe now try a little flick, that’ll make it or break it…
	
	Aaaaaagh, nope, goddammit you fucked up.
	
	You hang your head in shame, dangling your gaze directly above your failed cappuccino art piece. You’ve given your attempted octopus face quite a nasty gash across its bulbous cranium with that endeavour. Quite fitting, you know, given how the story goes. In any case you’re just gonna have to mush the foam all around now. Dispose of the evidence. She’ll never know.
	
	You deliver the failed beverage, laying the coffee down before her. She’s yet to open the leatherback omnibus she came in with – it’s set to side on the table, the golden text imprint along the thick spine gleaming the name “LOVECRAFT”. It teases you, reminding you to never again attempt any kind of tribute to your beloved writer. How endearing of an inanimate object. She mutters a word of thanks without raising her head, cueing you to turn your shameful ass and haul it back to the counter.
	
	Since all two customers in the café have received their orders, you decide to resume the *real* task at hand. Grab the pen, open the notepad to where you left off and continue writing. You spend a solid deal of time scribbling away. This is shortly interrupted, however, by a thick, leathery hand slamming onto the metal countertop beside you. The hand, of course, belongs to Michael, who thoroughly disapproves you dawdling away on his time. Of this he reminds you with one of his trademark firm facial scolds. You reply with a sheepish look of your own; the most common conversation in the café in which nobody utters an actual word. How’s Mara? you enquire, not so much as a subject-change but more so out of genuine interest. Been a few days since you’d last spoken. Michael’s face relaxes a little at the mention of his beloved. Ehh, she-a doin’ okay. They-a find aaaah…nother lump in the head. You still remember when Mara had been working here alongside her husband, and you remember being the first to reach her when she’d suddenly collapsed one day while carrying a tray of drinks to a table. Now that the necessary staff disciplinary actions have been taken, Michael turns and heads back towards his office. You’d always found it peculiar for someone to have an office in their café. Then again, you also found peculiar the boxes that were delivered around the back of the building. Peculiar, too, were the marks and stamps on said boxes. Logos you certainly didn’t recognise representing any coffee bean company. Not long after you first noticed those deliveries did you ask Michael about them, to which he simply replied with his most impressive stern face yet. You knew to leave it at that.
	
	Michael shambles into his office, a thick, calloused hand gripping the back of his neck like always when he was deep in thought. One thing you had always admired about Michael, or indeed any person of that age and calibre of experience, was whatever potential stories lay behind the grit, the wrinkles and the callouses in those hands. You never knew all that much about Michael during your stint at the café, not that it ever really bothered you a lot. You could tell he was decent, as was his beloved Mara, and you were content with that. Still, how does a man of such age and resolve, with hands that one might strike several matches across, wind up behind the desk of a café no bigger than your own apartment, making a turnover that surely couldn’t be self-sustaining? You had always had an inkling that the crates that often turned up around the back of the café were the answer to that. A top secret, external bloodstream pumping quickly and quietly through what should be a frail, sickly organism. You knew when to leave well enough alone. People like Michael seem to like that the young and inquisitive; you didn’t want to push far enough to find out if Michael did too. Let’s also not forget how Michael must be keeping his Mara in hospital…
	
	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
	
	
	Had the man in the hat always been sat at the booth, that day? A classic Nineteen Forties gangster’s hat. Pinstriped black, silver brim twisting and winding its way around like stealthy barb wire. You never saw him come in, let alone sit down. Did you? You remember a pinstriped black suit to match the hat, ironed pristinely – or rather, it seemed more like the suit itself could not even crease to begin with. The man may has well have been a two-dimensional image. You remember hands clasped together in front of the man, giving him a far more morose image than what sitting in a café waiting to be served might warrant. But why can’t you remember his face? Everything else is fine and clear. Hat, suit, tie posture, even which particular booth he sat in that day. So why is his face blank? You certainly saw it at the time… right?
	
	Regardless, you make your way over, pen and paper in hand, ready to fulfil one of your few actual duties as an employee of this establishment. There’s a kind of warmth radiating from the mysterious man, you can feel it despite his being sat in the centre of the booth. Must be the humidity beneath the black suit. You couldn’t bring yourself to meet his gaze, so to the centre of the table you flatly utter What can I get you today, sir? Initially, the man doesn’t budge. When at last he does reply, the voice is like a rumbling furnace, low but also grinding and nasal. Would you, per chance, have any water available in this establishment, young man?
	
	This perturbs you a little; if only you could remember the man’s face, you may also remember his expression when talking, and thus what tone may have been inflicted on his speech. Easy, you reply. You fetch the gentleman a glass and a bottle of cold water right from the bar fridge. You set it before the man, who again remains motionless. Many thanks, he grinds. This will do him just fine. You give a little courtesy nod then let your feet whisk you back behind the counter as they had been longing to do since you arrived at the table. You can’t take your eyes off the strange gentleman. In one swift movement the man seizes the glass bottle, flicks off the lid with his thumb and drains it of its contents in a matter of seconds. As the man exhales you could swear you saw something like steam exhuming from his breath. Surely, he has some kind of body temperature medical condition thing that makes him so immediately warm? Before you can give it much thought, the door behind the bar corner slides open, and out peers Michael’s iconic stern face aimed straight towards the strange man in the booth. Does Michael know this guy? That look seems to say so, and it doesn’t seem all that favourable either. Wordlessly and without shifting his gaze, Michael shuffles over to the booth and sits opposite the man. Only once Michael has settled in does the man move for the first time, merely raising his gaze to meet Michael’s. While you may not remember the man’s face specifically, you do remember the reflection of the man’s gaze in Michael’s simultaneously weary and compelled eyes in that moment.
	
	You’re brought out of your trance watching this by the chiming bell of the front door as the second-last customer leaves. All who remain in the building are you, Michael, the stranger and the Lovecraft girl, who at some point in this became immersed in her Eldritch tome. You try to avoid seeming like you’re paying attention to Michael’s soft and rigid exchange with the man. Occasionally the man lets out a chuckle, but Michael remains as stoic as ever during his reciprocations. Had the vibe of a business conversation, one which sounded like it ends with Michael on the shit end of the stick, given his expression. You hear the man make some kind of proposal, because the conversation comes to an uncomfortable, silent halt, and Michael meets your gaze. Something was wrong. One of the few things you remember of what transpired that afternoon was the complete look of utter dismay in Michael’s old eyes as he saw you and you saw him. The strange man’s head tilted slightly in your direction but not enough to look you in the face as well. You get the sickening feeling that the topic of you came up in the discussion. Michael turns back to the stranger with a solemn look, like a prisoner being handed down a very grim sentence. He heaves himself out of his chair and makes his way around the bar towards you. The stranger remains seated.
	
	Michael asked you to do something terrible that day. It was the last favour he’d ever asked of anyone. He had pleaded softly but rapidly, as though you and he both had a very short amount of time. He said he had cyanide salts in his office, and the girl sat at the other end of the café had to go. He couldn’t explain any further, he begged, but it had to be done for the betterment of everyone they both knew and loved. He implored you to think of Mara. All the while the suited man whose face you can’t remember remained sat and stoic in the booth to which he had never arrived, nor would he ever leave.
	
	Would you do it? *Could* you? To a complete stranger? There had been times you’d had this kind of discussion with people before, albeit purely in theory. Take a life to save a life? Ah, well of course it would all depend on whose lives were being taken and saved, respectively. You yourself had stipulated in those chats you could never draw somebody’s blood, hell no. But this would be poison, right? You wouldn’t have to touch her. Just give her a new coffee on the house. Michael had never said so, but you had quite the inkling he likely knew the proper procedure to follow such an act. He would take care of  the rest. But the main event had to be hosted by you and you alone. It was the only way.
	
	You brew the coffee, the exact same way the girl had it the first time. Classic cappuccino. This time you successfully etch a simple, lovely smiley face into the foam. May as well send her off with a nice touch. Michael slides you the salts along the bar discreetly despite her being the only potential witness. You sprinkle them in as casually as you can act. It’s just sugar, is all. Sugar, so sweet. With all your might you bring the coffee over to the girl without letting your shaking hands spill it, making the second rounds that day for the poor lass. You clear your throat before reaching her table. Round two, on the house, you say with a smile.
	
	You remember all the strength draining from you as you watch her hop up out of the booth with an apologetic smile of her own. No thanks, she had quipped. She’d already had her coffee fix for the day. Don’t you know how too much caffeine is bad for your sleep cycle? You should do a bit of research. You remember two simultaneous sounds: the chiming of the doorbell closing behind her and the coffee mug shattering at your feet. It’s all you can do to turn and look Michael in the eye as the both of you share a look of horror, of dismay and of helplessness. The look that a game show contestant may bear after watching a million dollars fall down the pit because he answered option “D” rather than option “C”.
	
	You both pay the price for having made the wrong decision that day.
	
	The strange man simply shakes his head, bearing a face that doesn’t exist anywhere in the depths of your memory.

	Everyone else who knew about Michael and his sudden death that day was so shocked and confused about the circumstances. Doctors couldn’t explain the sudden onset of a heart attack, right in the middle of his own café, right in front of his staff. Michael had had quite the clean bill of health leading up to it. Hell, you still don’t even know yourself, to this day. But your gut tells you it may have had something to do with a pinstriped suit and hat.

I've Been Hiding Under My Desk for 12 Hours

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpmeqm/ive_been_hiding_under_my_desk_for_12_hours/


	You’re probably wondering, “how did he get here?” Well, I’ll tell you; it all started with Dave’s fucking salmon casserole.
	
	
	It started around lunchtime yesterday. I’d been complaining to my cubicle neighbor - Karen - about the smell of Dave’s reeking salmon casserole that his wife made him bring to work for the past few days and Karen had been in the middle of telling me to bring it up with our manager when the fire alarm went off.
	
	We looked at each other and then around the office, we couldn’t *see* any fire anywhere, but being on the fifteenth floor, we didn’t want to take any chances. I picked up my phone and we walked out of cubicles. Perhaps it was just a drill, looking back, I wish it had been a drill. We walked out into the hallway with the elevators - like most office buildings you needed a pass to scan in to the actual work areas, confidentiality and the sort. I bee lined for the elevators, but the stream of people flowing from the office reminded me that in the case of a fire, you should always take the stairs.
	
	I was about to go and follow them when Karen grabbed my arm, “We’re taking the elevator”
	
	I looked at her confused, “What do you mean *Karen?* We have to take the stairs.”
	
	She looked at all the people going down the stairs, then at me, then at the elevator call button. She pressed the button and met my gaze, “oops, guess I’ll take the elevator. I’m not taking fifteen levels of stairs down to the main lobby for a drill. If it were real, we’d smell the smoke through the vents.”
	
	By now the flow of people had subsided and it was just the two of us on the floor. I looked at her, then to the door leading to the stairs, then to the light that dinged, saying the elevator had arrived. On impulse I went over to the elevator and got on, if the elevators were still functioning, then surely this *was* just a drill. Karen smiled smugly and came in after me.
	
	She pressed the ground floor button and the elevator began its slow descent, “So the boss is giving me some *pretty* important reports to work on, something to do with the expenses in our genetics department, all very hush hush. I think I’m in line for a promotion, isn’t that great?”
	
	I looked at her and blinked. Of all the other accountants I’d wanted to be in an elevator with, why did it have to be her, “Yeah, that’s just *great* Karen.”
	
	She smiled again, not sensing my sarcasm, “Yeah it is, you’d better start kissing my ass now Jim, if you ever want to get out of that entry level position.”
	
	My name’s Mark. I’ve told her that multiple times, yet she insists on calling me Jim.
	
	The elevator slowed and then came to a halt. I looked up to the floor display, surprised to see that the elevator hadn’t stopped on the ground floor like I’d thought. The small display showed the number seven and I frowned, though I figured perhaps someone else had pressed the call button on that floor and we’d simply get more passengers. I shrugged and passively listened to Karen - who was in the middle of a long winded rant about how she was so glad that *she* would finally be the manager- and pulled out my phone. Due to being blinded by her own brilliance, she didn’t notice that we hadn’t stopped on the proper floor and stepped out into the hallway.
	
	She turned back to me and noticed the horrified expression that was plastered across my face, confused, she asked, “What’s wrong Jim? Can’t fathom how amazing I am?”
	
	She turned and snickered stopping only moments before a large mass of grey steel crashed into her, splattering her against the wall. My breath caught and for the first time I allowed myself to peer out of the elevator passed the dead man in a white lab coat that had horrified me before. The walls were caked in blood and viscera, half a skull was stuck to the wall, marinating in a gooey glob of congealed blood and brain matter. Bits of white fabric were poking up here and there between masses of limbs and organs that had been pulverized by an unknown force. I choked back the bile as I looked to where Karen had ended up.
	
	What was left of Karen was pancaked on the wall, next to her was a large grey filing cabinet that was crumpled along the edges as if by some sort of vice-like mechanism. Her hair was splayed against the wall like a halo around her fragmented skull. Her Gucci handbag was still attached to her flattened arm though it was clearly stuck in the drywall. I choked back a scream filled with vomit as she began to peel off the wall, leaving her detached scalp behind. A thought crossed my mind, and in my shock, it took me a moment to realize what it implied.
	
	*What threw that filing cabinet?*
	
	I slowly turned, as if the longer I refrained from looking at it, the less likely chance it had of existing. Yet, as my eyes fell upon it, I knew it never *should* have existed. It stood nearly eight feet tall - it’s head nearly scraped against the roof. There were bandages covering the entirety of its neck and head, seemingly obscuring its vision entirely. Though it was anthropomorphic in nature, the similarities between it and a human stopped there.
	
	Its arms were thick with sinewy, skinless muscles that rippled with each minuscule movement the creature made. On each of its wrists were large shackles with chains dangling off of them. At the end of its right arm was a raptorial hand, each claw tipped with a large talon, at the end of its left was a huge metal spike that rested with its tip in the ground. Several large clear  tubes hung off its wide back and dangled to just above the floor and a black liquid flowed through them. Its legs were the size of tree trunks, each one tightly bound with leather straps that strained against the large vascular muscles. It stood still, moving only when it took in a deep breath from behind the bandages.
	
	A groan sounded from the other side of the floor, as if someone was pinned under something - and after seeing the huge filing cabinet it threw with such ease, I assumed that was the case. The creature moved in a flash, covering the distance between itself and where the noise came from in a matter of seconds. I heard the groan once more, followed by a series of sickening thuds as the creature brought its metal appendage down on the person over and over again. I turned to the floor buttons in the elevator, wondering why the damned thing wasn’t moving and my heart dropped. There were no more lights, no more power, just a single message displayed over the screen.
	
	**EMERGENCY - PLEASE USE STAIRS**
	
	I felt all hope leave me as I looked from the screen to the creature that was still thudding away on the person’s corpse, eviscerating whatever remained. I weighed my options and realized I had two; attempt to make it to the stairs, or die. I chose the former and began silently creeping along the wall, headed for the exit door at the end of the hall.
	
	I was nearly there when my foot landed on top of something squishy and wet; throwing my weight out from under me. I hit the ground with a loud thwack, throwing my phone in a large arc behind me, back towards the elevators. It hit the ground with a loud smash and to my relief, the creature was soon standing over it, and not me. I slowly rose to my feet - wincing as my eyes fell upon the piece of scalp stuck to the ground - as it began pulverizing my phone, I opened the stairwell door and crept inside, letting it click shut behind me.
	
	I began moving down the stairs, but stopped when I heard a roar coming from the lower down, *there’s more than one.* I felt like crying, I felt like throwing up, yet I turned and walked back up the stairs, all the way up back to floor fifteen; where I could use my office phone to call for help.
	
	
	You may be wondering; “why not stop on another floor and use someone else’s phone?” well. The answer is simple, our phones in this office are password protected, any time you want to use it, you have to enter a four digit code into the receiver, then dial a nine followed by the number you wish to call.
	
	
	Anyway, I finally got back up to my floor, and scanned my card on the access pad, gaining entry to the workspace. I walked quickly - yet quietly over to my desk and sat down in my chair, grabbed the phone and entered “9-911” I put the phone up to my ear, and… nothing. There was no static, no waiting tone, nothing. I hung up and tried again. Nothing. Unplugged and plugged it back in. Nothing. Disconnected and reconnected the CAT 3 cable from the back of the receiver. Nothing. I tried again and again, nothing ever changed.
	
	I sat back and began to cry softly into my folded arms, feeling the futility of my situation. I stopped when I heard a loud crash come from the door where I’d entered from. I quickly pulled down my monitor and my keyboard down with me under my desk.
	
	I’ve been typing this slowly for the past twelve hours in addition to browsing company files, stopping whenever I hear it walk by, it has been close several times so far, but I’m counting my blessings at this point. I just hope I make it out of here alive.
	
	
	Some of you may know where I am by now, but I’m asking, don’t come. Don’t help. The files revealed what it is, and you [can’t stop it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ipatusaur/comments/c5zzlh/catalog_of_writing/)

Wasps and bees can't mate, can they?

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpm8ot/wasps_and_bees_cant_mate_can_they/


	A strange phenomenon occurred in my small town. The bees and wasps began mating and creating these hybrids. No one knew why this was happening let alone *how* this was happening. Bees and wasps aren't able to mate, I'm sure? I hadn't seen any of these "hybrids", I didn't think they were real, probably a hoax.
	
	Apparently, one of the kids in my school got bit by one. The bite was on his right forearm. Nothing special, just looked like a regular bump. He said it didn't bother him. That's until one day we were outdoors doing P.E playing football (soccer). He had the ball, and just before he took a shot for the goal, he stopped dead in his tracks and began making guttural sounds. That was terrifying enough, but then he fell to the ground and started shaking uncontrollably.
	
	We found out he died a week later...or so we thought. My dad is a doctor in the local hospital and I overheard him and mum talking about how the kid from my school died. My dad never talks about work, so this was strange. Being a doctor is difficult and the stuff that happens in the hospital isn't something to discuss with family, he says. But he sounded pretty shaken up - another thing I don't associate with my father.
	
	Apparently, according to my dad, the kid from my school didn't "die". His brain was still working but blood wasn't flowing through his body; he had no heart beat. The doctors were perplexed. But my dad had more to say, his voice getting quieter and shakier with each passing word, and his head dropped almost as if what he saw was too heavy for his brain to bare. My mother leaned in closer, concern clearly evident on her face, as caressed his cheek with her hand, her own voice trembling, "what happened?"
	
	"The boy sat up. He fucking sat up on the autopsy table and starting making these horrible gargling noises..." My father fell silent, his eyes glazed over - I could tell he was reliving whatever he had seen. He didn't go on any further, it seemed as though whatever happened took a toll on his psyche. The night ended with silence and a lot of rumination on my part. Questions upon questions compounding into an incomprehensible mess.
	
	Fuck...I had to get to the bottom of this.
	
	I had a plan, but it wouldn't take affect until a few days had passed. This was because my father was recovering from the seemingly traumatic experience. I felt a little bad that it had piqued my curiosity so much. You see, my plan was to get to the morgue, which is where the guy's body is kept and to see all of this myself.
	
	A few days had passed and my dad regained his lustre and went back to work. I pretended to go to school, but when I got far enough away from home I re-directed my route to the hospital.
	
	I've been to the hospital many times before, and on my excursions through the place I discovered a lot of things, like who had the keys and where they kept them. So I'll spare you the details, but I made it to the morgue. I'll spare you even more details and say that I found the kid's body.
	
	I slowly pulled the body out and immediately jumped back a bit. The kid's eyes were open, and they were looking right at me. The veins in his arm - the one that had been stung, had begun bulging so much that they pierced through his skin. They splurged out like wires, purple and sickly looking. That dead stare sent sharp chills down my spine to my extremities.
	
	In the corner of my eye, I saw something move. It was small. It landed on the wall, I snapped my head around and saw that it was one of those wasp-bee hybrids. I'd never seen one up close, only on the news. It was big, as big as my face.
	
	It flew off the wall at a blinding speed, straight to the exposed dead(?) body in the morgue, landing on its abdomen where it began tearing out the flesh. The hybrid was digging into the body. I stood in place, frozen. All the while this was happening, the kid never took his eyes off me. The hybrid burrowed deeper and deeper until it disappeared, and a smile stretched upon the boy's face. He was enjoying this.
	
	I ran and I kept running. Down the hallways, to the main entrance, I heard my father's voice calling out my name, but overwhelming fear worked my legs. What did I just witness? The boy wasn't dead.
	
	News spreads quickly through the town, and, apparently, what I saw in the morgue had consequences. The boy reigned carnage upon the hospital. It took a lot of effort to restrain him. Last I heard he was taken into a remote location to be experimented on, but he wasn't the only "test subject" available now. The people he attacked and killed in the hospital started mutating just like him, and in the birth of these monstrosities, the hybrids were always close by.
	
	My father had been attacked while he was saving others. We went to visit him the in the hospital, in a special wing that had been opened for those affected.
	
	His heart rate monitor showed a flat line, but his eyes were still scanning the room.
	
	And, outside, on the windows, the hybrids were gathering.

The Horns from Hell (Part 2)

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpm6v1/the_horns_from_hell_part_2/


	[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dp5gmm/the_horns_from_hell/)
	
	I yelled in fright and leapt back, banging my foot on the corner of the sink cabinet. The sharp edge sliced through my bare skin, and now I was hopping on one leg, blood pouring from the cut on my foot, my thoughts spinning faster than I could handle.
	
	*What the hell was going on??*
	
	Acting on autopilot, I pulled open the top drawer and fished around for a band aid. Finding one, I ripped it open and went to apply it to my foot. Only thing was, there was now no cut there to cover. I wrenched my foot as close to my face as I could without toppling over. There was absolutely no sign of any wound. Blood was still trickling onto the floor, but the cut had completely disappeared. It had somehow…healed? In just a few seconds?
	
	I didn’t know what on Earth to do or how to handle anything anymore, and when my legs began to buckle, I let myself sit down hard on the bathroom tiles. This had to be a dream. No way could any of this be real.
	
	I slapped myself in the face. ‘Wake up!’ I snarled, and that only succeeded in giving me a sore face. Okay, I needed to calm down. *Deep breaths.*
	
	Slowly, I began to stand up. I closed my eyes, turned to the mirror, and braced myself. When I opened my eyes, everything would be normal again. This was not real.
	
	*This was not real.*
	
	I opened my eyes and saw the horn sticking out from my head and the broken glasses in the sink, and I wanted to cry. Why was this happening to me? What had I done to deserve this? Gingerly, I reached up, and slid my fingers across the surface of the horn. It was black, and about ten centimeters in length. It tapered up into a curved point at the top, and the base was rounded. The tip felt sharp, and I pressed the pad of my finger against it. A bead of blood welled up, and even as I watched, the skin closed over, the little mark gone in a few seconds. I stared at my finger for a long time, then sighed.
	
	So this was actually happening. Fantastic. Googling ‘horns grown overnight’ probably wouldn’t get me far. I was on my own with this.
	
	I turned my attention to the glasses, having dreaded this moment. I picked them up, and the glass in the sink shifted as I moved it. I studied the glasses, a deep pit opening up in my stomach. I could have put it down to a coincidence, that everyone wears sunglasses like this, that just because I met some guy with ones like them yesterday didn’t mean these were his.
	
	But if that was true, how did they get here then?
	
	I really didn’t want to think about the next question, but it was unavoidable.
	
	*If, for some unexplainable, awful reason, they were his…where was* ***he****?*
	
	I turned, looked out into my bedroom, at my shoes lying dirty and haphazard on the carpet. *And what did I have to do with this?*
	
	Still holding the glasses, I made my way into the living room. The tv remote was on the coffee table, and I picked it up. I paused before clicking the on button, not sure if I wanted to see whatever might be on the news. But I had to, or I’d never gain the courage again.
	
	And there it was.
	
	It wasn’t breaking news; people died all the time. But it was important to me. A reporter stood in the middle of a park I walked in occasionally. Police and forensic examiners moved behind her, inside yellow tape marking out a square no civilian was allowed to cross. A square in which a mound that looked suspiciously like a body lay. It was covered by a black sheet, but the shape was clear.
	
	My worst fears were confirmed as I heard the reporter speak. ‘In the early hours of this morning, 24 year old Dash Carter’s body was found. It appears he was strangled by an unknown assailant. Police are investigating further.’
	
	A photo of Dash popped up next to the reporter. I felt my mouth go dry, my stomach heave. It was him. The owner of the car with red rims and tinted windows. The jerk who’d almost cost me my life.
	
	And now he’d lost his.
	
	The more I stared at his picture, the more I hated the feeling that I had something to do with his death. The horn, the glasses, the shoes. Everything was connected.
	
	I flicked the channel abruptly, not wanting to see anything anymore. It landed on some other news channel, where a 90 year old lady was talking to the camera about some miracle or something. I only caught the last of her sentence. ‘-But I’m telling you, it’s true. I really did die, and now I’m alive again.’
	
	I switched the tv off. Delirious old grandma. I had bigger things to worry about. The major thing being  the fact that I was 97 percent sure I’d killed Dash Carter in my sleep and stolen his sunglasses.
	
	I sank down on the couch, suddenly feeling so tired and sad. Was this karma for something bad I had done when I was younger? Yeah, I hadn’t been the greatest kid growing up, but honestly, who was at 8 or 9?
	
	Yes, I’d accidently thrown a baseball through my neighbor’s window and blamed it on my brother when I was 13.
	
	Yes, I’d overfed my sister’s goldfish on purpose when she pissed me off about something, and when they died, refused to come to the ridiculous funeral she made for them.
	
	Yes, I’d talked back to my mum, argued with my dad. Had fights with my siblings, all of that. But that was all part of growing up. I’d never done anything to ask for this type of retribution.
	
	I’d broken up with my girlfriend a while back, true, but she’d been cheating on me! Not the other way around. I rubbed my hands across my face. This wasn’t fair. None of this was fair.
	
	I ran my hands through my hair, taking care not to poke myself on the tip of the horn, and that’s when I felt it.
	
	On the right side of my forehead.
	
	A pimple.
	
	‘No, no, no.’ I muttered frantically, leaping up and running to the bathroom.
	
	Just like the first one, it was coin sized. A nasty red colour. A definite pimple.
	
	Except it wasn’t, was it?
	
	I rubbed the spot in despair, but knowing, that like always, I couldn’t do anything. In a fit of sudden anger, I grabbed the left horn and pulled. Hot pain seared through the side of my head, and I gasped, staggering backwards.
	
	It wasn’t coming out anytime soon, that’s for sure.
	
	So was this it? Was I stuck being this…creature? A real life version of Hell Boy. Just not red, tall and badass.
	
	I wanted to scream, honestly.
	
	But even that wouldn’t do anything.
	
	\*\*\*
	
	I stayed inside all day. I couldn’t go out, obviously. Both the horn and the knowledge that the police were looking for Dash’s killer made me stay. I sat on the couch and stared numbly into space for hours. It was weird. My mind felt so crowded with thoughts, but when I tried to focus on one, I just got…nothing.
	
	I felt nothing.
	
	I had gotten to the point where I honestly just didn’t care anymore. I was a monster, a murderer. A guy who was in way too deep and had no way out. Fun times. The pimple on my right side had grown, I could feel it. I knew when I looked into the mirror, it would seem to be no different, of course. It was itchy as well, and that just made me feel worse.
	
	It was about 7:30 pm when a loud knock came at the door. I sighed. The police had found me. I knew I could do nothing but face up to what I’d done. No idea how I’d explain the horn, or how I’d actually killed Dash, but whatever. At least in jail I wouldn’t be able to kill anyone else.
	
	I went to the door and pulled it open. ‘Officers, I-‘
	
	I stopped in surprise. It wasn’t the police. It was my ex-girlfriend. Alia stood on my doorstep, head down. I crossed my arms.
	
	‘What do you want?’
	
	She lifted her head, and despite my anger at her suddenly turning up, I felt cold when I saw the ugly bruise across her cheek. She locked eyes with me, and I expected her to say something about my horn, but it never came.
	
	‘I left a jacket here, I just came to get it,’ she said quietly, and her voice was nothing like the loud, boisterous tones I’d known.
	
	The sight of her made me momentarily forget about my problems. ‘Are you sure? I thought you did a pretty thorough search of the house when you moved out.’
	
	She hugged her arms, looking smaller than ever. ‘I must have left here. I can’t find it anywhere. Look, can I just check your bedroom quickly? I promise I’ll be gone in a second.’
	
	This wasn’t the Alia I’d known. She used to be outgoing, mischievous, fun loving. Yeah, she cheated and yeah, I didn’t think much of her anymore, but seeing her like this didn’t give me any pleasure. I had an inkling as to why she’d changed so much though, and it was soon proven true. A car honked behind Alia, and when I looked at the driver, I felt my jaw clench. Alia’s new boyfriend, the one she decided she preferred kissing over me, sat in the driver’s seat.
	
	He flipped me the bird and took a long drag on the cigarette between his fingers. ‘Hurry up,’ he yelled to Alia, then honked again.
	
	‘I didn’t think it was possible for Rion to be any more charming, but apparently I’m wrong.’ I said, waiting for the dickhead to point at my horn and laugh, and feeling confused when he didn’t.
	
	Alia shot me a look. ‘Stop it.’ She pushed past me into the house and went straight down the hall. I closed the door and waited for her to return. When she did, empty handed, I raised an eyebrow.
	
	‘Told you it wasn’t here.’
	
	‘Shut up,’ she replied, but a small smile touched her lips. ‘Guess I was wrong.’
	
	‘And am I wrong in thinking you got that shiner by walking into a door?’
	
	Her smile fell, and she went to the door. ‘It’s nothing. Forget about it.’
	
	She had hurt me badly, and I would never truly forgive her for what she did, but some miniscule part of me still cared for her. I know, it was stupid, but I couldn’t help it.
	
	‘Alia, you need to leave him. He’s dangerous.’
	
	‘He’s fine. I’m fine. Mind your own business.’ She went to open the door, and I put my hand on it, keeping it shut. She turned to glare at me and I reluctantly dropped my hand.
	
	‘Alia, please. Don’t be stupid.’
	
	That was the wrong thing to say. She stared at me for a long moment, then yanked the door open and left. I watched her walk away, back to Rion, who snapped at her for taking too long as she got in the car. I felt a muscle in my jaw clench as I watched the way Alia cowered back into her seat, her hair falling back into her face, hiding her from his view. From my position on the doorstep, I saw her glance out the window, back towards me. And I saw, just for a second, the raw desperation and vulnerability in her eyes, the pleading expression she hid from Rion and only showed me. ‘I’m sorry,’ she mouthed.
	
	I wasn’t sure what she was sorry for, exactly. Cheating on me. Getting with Rion. Staying with him despite what he did to her.
	
	As Rion put the car in reverse and revved the engine, as Alia sunk down lower past the window, dropping her gaze from mine, I felt the right pimple on my forehead begin to pulse with a dull ache. It was the same feeling I’d got yesterday, in the car pack with Dash.
	
	I looked at Rion pulling out of my drive, backing over my lawn in the process, calling me a wanker as he sped off, and the ache increased. As the car turned the corner, Alia disappearing from my sight, I felt something like a weird tingle at the base of my left horn.
	
	And it was then, as I touched my horn gently, I realised neither Alia nor Rion had said anything about it. Anything at all.
	
	It was like they hadn’t noticed. I turned to go inside, and a little thought stopped me in my tracks.
	
	*Maybe they just couldn’t see it? Maybe I was the only one who could?*
	
	I hesitated. It made sense, didn’t it? I healed injuries in a few seconds, I disappeared across town during my sleep, and now no one but myself could see the horn growing from my head. If we were following the pattern of weirdness, then it really wasn’t that unbelievable. Right?
	
	Only one way to properly find out.
	
	I quickly stepped outside, closed my front door and bounded down the path. Crossing the road, I went straight to the house opposite mine and knocked on the door. A middle aged woman answered, looking frazzled. I could smell something burning from behind her and gave a pleasant smile.
	
	‘Sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you knew where Airedale Court was?’
	
	She sighed and pointed to her left. ‘Down there, turn right at the first intersection.’
	
	I thanked her and she was already closing the door before I got all the words out. Her rudeness didn’t bother me though; I was focused on more important things. My experiment had given me interesting results. No one could see my horn but me.
	
	I don’t know what I felt at that moment. Not really. It wasn’t happiness, but it also wasn’t despair anymore. I could still go out in public, still function as a normal person. There *was* just that small problem of me killing Dash Carter, but maybe nothing would come of that? If my horn wasn’t visible, what else could be hidden from the world?
	
	I walked back to my house, lost in thought, and only came back to reality when I stepped on something on my lawn. Looking down, I saw numerous cigarette butts strewn across the grass. One was still smoldering gently. The tire marks of Rion’s car, scarred into my lawn’s surface, sat next to them. I stared down at the mess for a few seconds, and unbidden, the memory of Alia’s nasty bruise floated into my mind. The way she had looked so scared next to Rion, the way he had snarled at her, the way he had laughed as he ripped up my lawn when leaving. The way people like him, like Dash, existed and ruled over everyone else with fear and force.
	
	I felt the dull ache return to my pimple, felt like my heartbeat was thudding loudly through my ears, felt my left horn give another small tingle.
	
	And I decided to try another experiment.
	
	\*\*\*
	
	When I woke the following morning, I had an idea as to what I might see in the mirror. When I got up to look, instead of feeling anguish or frustration, I felt something not unlike triumph.
	
	My left horn now had a partner.
	
	Overnight, the right pimple had grown into the second glossy horn, and now, looking in the mirror, I had to admit it. Once you saw past the minotaur/Hell Boy look, I looked pretty cool. Pretty badass, to be honest.
	
	Then I glanced into the sink, already guessing as to what I’d see.
	
	A single, unlit cigarette lay in the bottom of the sink. I picked it up, and turned to look into my bedroom, just like I had done with the glasses yesterday morning. I distinctly remembered putting my shoes in my wardrobe last night. I’d even taken a photo of them in there, for evidence. They were tossed back under my bed, the laces trailing once more.
	
	When I turned on the tv in the living room, I knew what would be playing. Sure enough, there she was. The reporter from yesterday, looking too gleeful for someone who was reporting another murder. Probably the biggest stories she’d got all year, in her defense. Nothing ever happened in my town. Not until now.
	
	’21 year old Rion Harvall, who was last seen late last night, was found dead in his garage by his father, at about 5:30 this morning. Like Dash Carter, he appears to have been strangled. Police say this is the work of the same killer, and a growing investigation is underway. Rion will be dearly missed by his parents, girlfriend and friends.’
	
	Not by Alia. Not by me.
	
	I felt a tingle of guilt towards his parents but shook it off. I couldn’t take back what I’d done. And if I was being perfectly honest…I didn’t want to. I didn’t regret what had happened.
	
	If you were in my position, had my abilities, what would you have done?
	
	My phone buzzed on the kitchen table, drawing me from my cloudy thoughts. It was the supermarket I’d had the interview with two days ago. I’d got the job, could I start on Monday?
	
	I could hardly believe it. Things were, incredibly, looking up. The supermarket asked me to come in today to fill out some paperwork, and I did want a walk, so I agreed, told them I’d be there in 20.
	
	It was sunny outside again. The warm rays shone down on my face; the gentle breeze tossed my hair back. My horns stood up proudly, exposed for everyone to see, but no one did. I passed many people on my way to the store, and each time marveled at their oblivious nature. It was quite amusing, to be honest. It was funny to think that I’d gone from hating these horns to accepting and showing them off.
	
	I still wasn’t totally at ease with the whole murder side effect, don’t get me wrong, but it helped my conscience to know only those who deserved it suffered.
	
	I reached the crossing where everything had started, and this time walked by without any trouble. I got to the supermarket with plenty of time to spare, and the manager took me through all the papers I had to sign. One of them was to prevent me from suing them if I was injured in their store, or under their management, and I tried not to laugh at it. If I was injured, I wouldn’t sue them to get my revenge. Not if I could go one better…
	
	(That was a joke, by the way. I wouldn’t kill any of my colleagues. Not unless they were *really* asking for it.)
	
	Leaving the store, I felt better than I had for days. I had a job. Alia was free from her abusive partner. And my horns…those random, weird, slowly-growing-on-me horns…I barely even noticed they were there anymore.
	
	I turned a corner, and in my happy little bubble, didn’t notice the woman coming towards me. I knocked my hip into something hard, and realised she was pushing a pram and I’d bumped it. ‘Oh, shit, I’m so sorry!’ I said, then my eyes caught up with my brain and I realised I knew her. ‘Oh, hi!’
	
	It was the mother from yesterday, the one I’d helped across the road. She began to look up at me, laughing easily. ‘Whoops, sorry about that. Hope I didn’t hit you to-‘
	
	She broke off abruptly, stepping back with a gasp. Her eyes were fixed on mine, and she’d gone completely still.
	
	With a sudden cold chill running up my spine, I realised there was only one reason as to why she was staring at me with such shock.
	
	She wasn’t looking at my eyes, she was looking above them.
	
	***She could see my horns.***
	
	***The ones I’d thought no one else in the world could see.***
==================================================
Farmer Pete's Haunted Kids Corn Maze

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpm2f6/farmer_petes_haunted_kids_corn_maze/


	I know the sign said ‘Kids Corn Maze’. But that didn’t stop us. Autumn was in the air, and we were feeling the Halloween spirit. Besides, I think being a young couple, still madly in love allows you to do some kids stuff. It becomes less about the thrill of kids stuff and more about the thrill of being together. The cutesy kids stuff becomes whimsical and charming. I’m pretty sure my girlfriend agreed with me.
	
	
	Lacey and I had been together for about six months at that point, and she’d told me all about Farmer Pete’s Halloween Haunt over at Downie Farms. It had been something of a family tradition for her since she was young. She didn’t want this to be the first year she didn’t go. Her parents were no longer around and her sister had gone last weekend with her husband and their kids. Usually they brought her with them, but not this year. I suppose they figured she’d want to go with me instead.
	
	
	I’d never actually done anything at Dowie Farms before. Sure, I’d gone to the storefront to buy produce with my own family. But I’d never done any of their seasonal activities. They really were more for kids, but we weren’t the only couple who’d gone. My friend Stephen had told me he’d gone with his girlfriend last year and he’d seemed to really enjoy it. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t just as excited for it as she was! This was special to her, and so of course it was also special to me. After just six months, I could tell I wanted to spend the rest of my life with Lacey. She was a short brunette with an infectious smile and the cutest laugh I’d ever heard. I’d always thought of myself as a funny guy, and loved to make bad jokes. Admittedly, I did try too hard sometimes. But Lacey didn’t care. She usually laughed anyways, especially if the jokes were bad or just outright dark. We seemed to share the same morbid sense of humor.
	
	
	The sun was low in the sky by the time we got to the farm. We’d both enjoyed sleeping in before meeting up for lunch and watching a movie together. I’d hoped the crowds at the farm would be gone, but it seemed the attractions were more popular than I’d anticipated.
	
	“Watch out for the stroller.” Lacey said as we were looking for a place to park. A young family with two little kids was making their way down the grass field that was being used for parking and towards us.
	
	“I’ll go for the parents instead.” I said and she giggled.
	
	“If you get them both, maybe one of the kids’ll grow up into Batman.” She raised her eyebrows playfully at me. I stopped the car and let the family pass. Their baby was fast asleep, but their little girl looked at my Nissan Rogue as she passed. She had big blue eyes and was cute as a button. I hoped I’d have a kid like that someday.
	
	
	We found a parking spot and made our way deeper into the farm. There’d been a good turnout that day. A tractor pulled a cart full of people to the different attractions set up along the farm. Lacey looked at the program on her phone.
	
	“So, we’ve got the Haunted House, the Fairy Village, the Corn Maze and the pony rides…” She said, along with a few other things I wouldn’t remember later. I could see the pony rides up ahead along with the entrance to the corn maze.
	
	“Then the Haunted Hayride begins at 8.” She added, “So we’ve got about four hours.”
	
	The farm was bathed in the golden glow of late afternoon and I wasn’t entirely sure there’d even be four hours worth of activities.
	
	
	“Well, let’s explore first and see what comes to us.” I said. That seemed good enough for her. We started walking towards one of the distant barns. I could see the Haunted House up ahead, and beside it was a pen with a few of the farm animals. A couple of goats and a tiny horse.
	
	
	*‘No thanks! We’re already well fed. We don’t need any more!’* Said a sign on the fence. Lacey stopped a few feet away from it and admired a goat eating some of the fallen autumn leaves. She grinned with an almost childlike wonder at it and I found myself grinning too. The goat continued to eat obviously as it began to shit without a care in the world. Lacey looked at me, smile fading as she shook her head.
	
	“Gross…”
	
	I just chuckled at the obscene absurdity of it all.
	
	“Guess he wants some privacy. Hey, the Haunted House is just over there. Want to check it out?”
	
	She looked over at it before giving a shrug.
	
	“Sure.”
	
	I took her hand as we headed over. I could sense a bit of apprehension as we approached. I knew she didn’t particularly enjoy those haunted houses, but I appreciated the fact that she tried.
	
	
	“Are you here for the haunted house?” Asked the girl in front of us. She couldn’t have been older than 17. I told her that we were.
	
	“Alright. Well, what scare level do you want? Low, Medium or High?”
	
	I looked at Leigh, and raised an eyebrow. She looked at me, eyebrows raised in turn. Without speaking a word, we had an entire conversation where we negotiated the terms of how scary we wanted the haunted house.
	
	“Medium.” I finally said. Leigh seemed fine with that.
	
	The girl opened the door of the haunted house, stuck her head through and screamed:
	
	“MEDIUM!” before closing the door and grinning at us, “You can go right in.”
	
	I took Leigh’s hand and smiled as I led her through the Medium Haunted House experience.
	
	
	The set was pretty nice. There were rooms full of creepy dolls, spiderwebs and hanging body parts. Just the atmosphere was enough to creep me out a little. The people wandering through the set and screaming at us were mostly out of costume, but they did their jobs decently. A teenager in a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey seemed to be stalking us from the other side of the far wall. As we made our way through the rooms, she’d peek her head through holes in the wall to scream at the top of her lungs. Every time Leigh flinched, the teenage girl grinned and snickered. That was the worst of it though. Leigh was tense and laughing nervously by the time we left, and I kissed her hand to thank her for trying for me.
	
	“That was alright.” She said softly, “The screaming was a bit much.”
	
	“It kinda was. I’m glad we settled on medium. Kinda wish we did low actually.”
	
	“Next time.” She said cracking a soft smile. She had the cutest smiles in the world.
	
	Up ahead I spotted a sign for the corn maze.
	
	“Want to give that a try?” I asked, gesturing to it.
	
	“Yeah, for sure! Let’s do it!” She squeezed my hand as we headed towards the maze.
	
	
	The old stalks of corn stood tall and a wooden sign depicting a zombie pointed the way. The word ‘ENTER’ was written across his arm. Lacey and I watched as a small family disappeared into the corn and we followed them. The fallen stalks across the dirt path crunched under our feet as we made our way through the maze. Above the corn, I could see the grain silo against the late afternoon sky. It was a useful landmark to give me an idea as to where we were.
	
	“Left or right?” Lacey asked as we reached a fork. The family ahead of us was long gone.
	
	“Right.” I said. It looked like it went deeper into the maze, and honestly I kinda wanted to get lost. It was part of the experience, wasn’t it?
	
	Lacey just smiled and made her way down the right hand path and I followed her.
	
	“Aww, honey look!”
	
	She paused as I caught up with her.
	
	“It’s Elsa.”
	
	Propped up on a post in the corn was the vaguely human shape of the beloved Ice Queen from Frozen. She looked to be just a human shaped sack dressed in clothes with a face painted on. An old blue dress and white shawl adorned the figure. She had no hair, but someone had tied a wig into a braid and draped it over her shoulder. It was as good as it needed to be.
	
	“That’s cute!” Lacey said, and I snapped a picture. She continued onwards, and stopped to point out Olaf a few feet away.
	
	“He’s even got a little sign.” She said. I could see it down by his feet.
	
	*‘How many stomachs does a cow have?’* There were 4 possible answers down below.
	
	“That’s cute.” Lacey said again before we continued on.
	
	
	A few feet later, we also saw Peppa Pig and her family, as well as what I think was Paw Patrol characters. Lacey didn’t stop to fawn over these ones as much. But we did call them out as we saw them. We paused for the educational little signs as well.
	
	*“Did you know that baby goats are called Kids.”* She read off one of them. She looked at me.
	
	“I dunno, did you know that?”
	
	“I had no idea.” I said half jokingly,
	
	Lacey nudged me as we continued on.
	
	“Is that Frozen again?” I asked as I saw a white shawl in the corn ahead of us. Her eyes narrowed as she approached.
	
	“It looks like it… Yeah… That’s Elsa. Did we go in a circle?”She looked around, but this area of the maze didn’t seem familiar.
	
	“I don’t think so…?”
	
	“Maybe they just repeat.” I said and shrugged. Lacey seemed to accept that as an answer.
	
	“Probably…”
	
	She looked down the aisles of the maze, and I looked around for the grain silo I’d been using to keep us oriented.
	
	“Let’s try left.” I said when I spotted it, “That should take us closer to the exit.”
	
	Leigh continued off to the left, and as she did, I heard movement behind me. On instinct, I looked back, expecting to see some other patrons of the maze approaching us from behind. Instead I saw nothing. Not even the white shawl of the Elsa dummy. I frowned but kept walking. I didn’t think too much of it. There wasn’t really a reason to suspect anything sinister. Not yet at least.
	
	Leigh stopped ahead of me when she saw another trivia sign. This one had been knocked over. She bent down to pick it up and set it right, but her brow furrowed as she read it.
	
	“How many children did Lightning McQueen kill…?” She murmured, and looked at me, “Lightning McQueen didn’t kill kids!”
	
	“Teenagers pulling a prank maybe?” I asked as I read the sign. I turned it around and knocked it into the corn, then gave the base a kick to hide it.
	
	“That’s just mean. Kids might read that.”
	
	Lacey nodded in agreement before continuing deeper into the maze.
	
	
	Around a bend in the corn, we paused as we reached a dead end. The Paw Patrol figures were waiting for us. There were 4 dogs painted on old sacks and they were placed side by side at the edge of the corn. Their eyes stared down the narrow rows, directly at us. It felt like they were waiting for us.
	
	“Guess we’re intruding.” Lacey murmured, “They look upset.” She smiled at me and began to turn around. I didn’t leave just yet though.
	
	They did kinda look upset… Their eyes seemed way too focused on us. I turned away, looking back as if I was expecting them to follow me. The Paw Patrol did no such thing. They just continued to stare… Of course they did. They were just sacks painted to look like fictional dogs! They’d probably been put there to soften the blow of a dead end for any kids. This was a kid friendly maze after all.
	
	“There’s another one of those signs.” Lacey said from up ahead of me.
	
	“What’s it say this time?”
	
	*“How many teeth does Tom Hanks have?”*
	
	I looked over her shoulder at the sign, which read exactly that. But the multiple choice answers underneath were even weirder.
	
	
	*-32*
	*-427*
	*-8021*
	*-Infinite*
	
	
	“If that’s supposed to be a joke, I don’t get it.” I said.
	
	“Me neither.” Lacey murmured. She looked up at the maze ahead of us, and bit her lip as she spotted Sheriff Woody peeking out of the corn rows.
	
	“Christ…”
	
	“That’s not creepy at all.” I murmured. “It’s just a prank, hun.”
	
	I took her hand and escorted her past the beloved animated Sheriff, glaring suspiciously at him all the while.
	
	“Let’s just get out of this maze.” Lacey said, “This is starting to wear out its welcome.”
	
	We picked up the pace as we walked.
	
	
	Somewhere in the distance, I could hear movement in the corn. The sky was a pastel pink with orange hues and the air around us was dead silent. No kids. No animals. Just our footsteps and the rustling in the corn. Lacey looked back anxiously and held my hand tight. Ahead of us, I saw another sign with a farm fact posted on it.
	
	
	*‘When you die, who takes you to Hell?’*
	
	
	I didn’t stop to let Lacey get a look at it. I just kept walking.
	
	“We should be almost out.” I murmured as I looked at the grain silo against the darkening sky. It seemed a lot closer than it had been before… That was good, right?
	
	“Yeah…” She didn’t sound convinced. Still, we kept walking. We kept walking until we saw the shapes ahead of us. Then we both stopped in our tracks.
	
	
	Lacey’s hands went to her mouth, as if masking a scream. I could only stare in horror. In the path ahead of us were three corpses. Not props. Real corpses. They’d belonged to the family who had come in ahead of us. I recognized the jacket on the little boy, who thankfully lay face down in the dirt… I would have broken down crying if I’d had to see his face.
	
	
	The Father lay partially in the corn, eyes staring vacantly up into the sky. His mouth was open in a scream of terror and blood trickled down his slit throat. The Mother lay in a heap on the ground. I could see blood on her white shirt though, enough to stain parts of it a dark red. The blood was still wet. These were fresh kills.
	
	“Oh my God…” Lacey murmured, “Oh my God…”
	
	She pressed herself against me and I wrapped my arms protectively around her.
	
	“I’ll call the Police…” I murmured and reached for my phone. Attempting to dial anything failed though. I had no signal. Neither did Lacey.
	
	
	My heart skipped a beat as I heard the corn rustle behind us. Both of us turned around immediately. There, standing in the middle of the corn maze was Peppa Pig. The burlap she was made from was stained with blood. The wooden post that kept her in place was planted firmly in the ground and she stared at us defiantly. She sure as hell hadn’t been there before
	
	“We’re leaving… Now…” I murmured. I looked up at the Silo before taking Lacey’s hand and pulling her into the corn. I was done with the Maze. I just wanted out. We moved as fast as we could, and I kept that silo in sight. It wasn’t far… Maybe just a five minute walk. We could make it five minutes, right? Behind me, I could hear the corn rustling. I could hear movement. My heart was racing and it almost stopped when I heard Lacey cry out.
	
	“Lacey!”
	
	“I’m okay! It… It’s another fucking sign…”
	
	There amongst the corn, I could see it. In the fading twilight, I could only barely read the text.
	
	
	*‘Who will find you when we are done?’*
	
	*-Your Mother*
	*-Your Father*
	*-The Police*
	***-No one***
	
	
	The words *‘No One’* were circled in blood. I looked up, just past the sign and through the corn, I could see something blue and white. I could only barely make out the painted on eyes of Elsa watching us and beside her, I swore I could see Sheriff Woody. There was a rustling beside us, and I turned to see Peppa Pig, almost close enough to touch us. Leigh let out a startled cry, and shrank back. I grabbed her hand and started to run.
	
	
	It was barely even a minute before we broke through the corn, but by God that minute felt like it took forever… We did break through though, and found ourselves on another path of the maze.
	
	“Damnit…” Lacey murmured, “Let’s just cut through the corn again… Then we’ll call the cops…”
	
	I wasn’t so sure that was a good idea. The Grain Silo didn’t seem to be any closer… It seemed to be in the exact same place.
	
	“I don’t think we should.” I said, “I… I think they didn’t like that…”
	
	Lacey opened her mouth to argue with me, before falling silent. The corn rustled around us, and she inched closer to me.
	
	“Maybe they didn’t…” She murmured, “Let’s just go, then… We’ll get out normally…”
	
	She took my hand and took off down the row. Our walking quickly turned into running.
	
	
	I spotted additional signs on the path, more than I’d seen before. I briefly saw glimpses of Woody, Elsa, Peppa Pig and others amongst the corn. Pooh Bear watched us from one fork in the road, and when I looked back I saw him and Tigger standing side by side in the path, as if blocking off our return.
	
	“Where’s the fucking exit…” Lacey said under her breath, “Come on, come on…”
	
	She checked her phone again, hoping for a signal but still found nothing. I just held her hand and focused on continuing forwards. The sky was getting darker and I could hear the movement amongst the corn.
	
	They were coming.
	
	“There’s something up ahead!” Lacey said, “I think I see the exit!”
	
	We broke into a run, sprinting for the escape. Sure enough there was a clearing just ahead of us… Maybe it was a way out! It had to be!
	
	As we emerged into the clearing though, we realized the truth. It was not an escape. This was something else entirely.
	
	
	My breath caught and my blood froze in my veins as I looked at the figures around us… All human, all strung up like scarecrows. I could see the family we’d discovered earlier amongst the corpses. But there were so many more… Fifteen, twenty perhaps. Maybe even more.
	
	“There are two empty ones…” Lacey said softly, and my eyes were drawn to them. They were set to face each other… and somewhere in the deepest part of my mind, I knew why.
	
	We wouldn’t be dead when they mounted us… They wanted us to watch each other die. That was where the thrill was, wasn’t it? The corn rustled behind us, and I turned to see Peppa Pig watching us from the edge of the corn. It may have just been the darkness, but I could have sworn she was smiling… I could have sworn that her mouth was open and I could see drool dribbling down her chin.
	
	
	Lacey took my hand, tears beginning to stream down her cheeks. We both took a step back as Peppa Pig loomed into the clearing. I could see Elsa and Woody behind her. I could hear the rustling of their movements. They moved bonelessly and shuffled forwards. It was inhuman and strange to watch. But they did it all with single minded purpose. They had come for us, and nothing would deter them.
	
	“Let’s go…” I said, “Run, RUN!”
	
	She didn’t need to be told twice.
	
	
	Again we ran, breaking through the wall of corn ahead of us. This time we had no direction. We just wanted to get away from the horrible things that were following us, and I didn’t know if that was even possible at this point. We ran blindly, hands linked as we fled, swatting corn out of our way. We ran until we broke through the corn one last time and stumbled out into the main event area.
	
	
	Lacey broke down crying as she saw the Haunted House we’d been through. I saw the Pony giving its final ride of the day.
	
	“We’re out. WE’RE OUT!”
	
	She threw her arms around me and I hugged her back in turn. She laughed that laugh I’d fallen in love with and I was laughing too… Until I saw it. At the edge of the corn, I could see Peppa Pig watching us. I held my girlfriend closer, leering at the creature that had hunted us, silently praying it would retreat. It did. Slowly, Peppa Pig pulled back until she vanished into the corn. She’d been there for only a few seconds. Long enough to let us know how close they’d been to catching us… Then they were gone, and so were we.
	
	
	We didn’t report the bodies to the Police. Lacey didn’t agree with that, but I know she understood. I didn’t know if the Police would even find any bodies, and even if they did, my story about being chased by Peppa Pig and Elsa through a corn maze would sound too insane to warrant checking out. Even if I’d lied and only said that I’d discovered the bodies, the Police would still have questions I couldn’t answer. In the end, it was easier not to bother.
	
	
	I love Lacey.  One day I want to marry her. She is my best friend, she is the love of my life. She is my partner in crime and in everything else. I would do anything for her and with her. But I will never return to Downie Farms, regardless of what her family tradition is, and I don’t think she will either.
==================================================
Late night in the morgue

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpm27c/late_night_in_the_morgue/


	
	
	I'm sure you guessed already but I work in a hospital as a Doctor. No, I'm no forensic pathologist, but I was originally training to be one before I decided I preferred the living instead and assisting them. But after years of med school, I have found myself working in this small hospital sometimes assisting the incompetent forensic pathologist we have here.
	
	Sometimes they won't be sure of something so they ask me to double-check or I've spotted a huge mistake in the deceased's medical files and have had to check the bodies personally to find the real issues. This has been going on for years though and is honestly pretty casual in my hospital that I assist in the alternate field. I never enjoy it though, despite the preservation of the bodies with cooling, they still smell.
	
	It was late on Saturday night, well past my time to leave, my shift had ended 3 hours ago but Ralph messed up again. I've put in several complaints about his casual misconduct and sheer stupidity but somehow he remained to keep me up fixing his mistakes. The patient in question Quentin Ramirez was shot to death by police.
	
	He was a homeless crazy who stabbed a woman in the chest 6 times and was shot 8 times by police from what I recall. Ralph had his cause of death written as heart failure the idiot.
	
	I took a look at him, he had the stitching from the autopsy forming that capital 'Y' on his chest and seven bullet wounds across his torso, 5 in the guts and 7 in his chest, 2 in his left thigh, the last was just above his eyebrow. I understand why he had to be killed, I understand he was out of control and had already killed a civilian but 15 times seemed unnecessarily excessive. 1,2 or 3 should be the most you have to shoot someone.
	
	I overheard some staff speaking about Ramirez saying he was already down when two other officers arrived and let off a couple of rounds to be safe. It's like a madhouse in here. Ramirez was a thin, elderly Latino man, aged 66 and only 100 pounds. His body was nothing special. He was thin, you could almost make out his rib cage, his skin was sun-browned from years of not using sun cream and just letting himself burn under the sun. He had several scars along his forearms, hands and fingers.
	
	X-rays showed that the bones appeared to have been broken several times and all healed improperly. The joints looked above average thickness and size. Like the bones had reconstructed themselves far too many times. Similar activity appeared in his skull specifically the forehead. But on the outside, there were no visible signs of this. He didn't appear big-boned, his hands weren't large or swollen and neither was his forehead.
	
	I was sick of this. There was nothing to discuss. Quentin Ramirez had an odd bone structure and was shot to death. I called Ralph this time to maybe think about how much of an idiot he could be. I used the phone from his desk and began ringing, the first time nothing but the second time he quickly picked up.
	
	"Yeah what?" He groaned.
	
	"Hey, it's me, Thomas." I said,
	
	"Hey it's like midnight, you know I start early cause of traffic, what is it?"
	
	"Guess where I am?... I'm fixing your fuck up... you listed Quentin Ramirez's cause of death under heart failure. He was shot to death. He even has a bullet wound in his skull!"
	
	"Hey... just listen, man, it looks like a screw up I know but lemme talk."
	
	"What the hell is there to talk? 15 times he was shot!"
	
	"Yeah, he stabbed a girl in front of a cop, dragged her away and kept stabbing her. He called for back up and once the old bastard dropped the woman the cop shot him in the head..." Ralph said pausing for my response
	
	" Congratulations, a guy gets shot in the head and you still list it as heart failure," I said cynically
	
	"NO! He didn't go down. Why do you think other cops even arrived and shot him. 3 cops and 14 more bullets. He wouldn't go down. He even ran at them. Then he just stopped. He had a goddamn heart attack. But something was happening to his hands and forehead. Cops couldn't explain so we got the X-rays. I told em what I found and they said that couldn't explain it."
	
	"Oh man you know I don't believe any of that crap."
	
	"I'm serious, check out the police report and check out his heart. Talk to me again in the morning I'm done with this weird shit today." Ralph hung up.
	
	I was about done with his shit when I slammed the phone on his desk. I was reading through the police report and everything he had just told me was true. Ramirez was unstoppable.
	
	15 rounds all hits including a headshot. But there was something about his hands and forehead. Something was growing from his forehead and his hands were large, sharp and glowing. What the actual fuck I thought to myself. Was this some kind of messed up joke gone way too far I originally thought.
	
	But then I decided to take a second look at Ramirez's body specifically his arms and forehead. I moved his long matted grey hair away from his face and held a small light to his forehead. I found scars just under his hairlines two of them both recent they couldn't have been older than a year or so. They looked like exit wounds like something had forced its way out. I lifted his head to search for anything that could've penetrated the back of his skull. Nothing.
	
	The room felt colder, I even felt a shiver crawl its way up my spine. I decided that it was late and that I would look further into the possibility of heart failure then discuss it later with Ralph. I had to get some sleep.
	
	I closed Ramirez into his drawer. I packed up and cleaned the equipment I used and was about to leave when I was caught staring at the floor. It was covered in a black fog, it wasn't smoke, it wasn't rising to the ceiling, nothing smelt like it was burning if it was smoke I definitely would've smelt it by now. The room instead got only colder. I could see my breath thicker before it was barely noticeable now great white whisps were pouring out.
	
	I panicked as the black fog grew thicker and I could no longer make sense of the floor. It was so thick and then came the smell. The vile smell, it was gut-wrenching. I couldn't breathe through my mouth anymore it was disgusting. I tried rushing to the door but the fog slowed me, I was practically tripping over my own feet.
	
	I turned around to see the fog emanating all from Ramirez's draw. The corners of the small square door were spilling the fog out into the room. The smell became more familiar, it smelt like someone had been rotting.
	
	I froze in fear, it wasn't the cold that did this, if anything I preferred the cold in comparison to warm weather, so it didn't bother. The only thing that bothered me was the heavy breathing coming from Ramirez's drawer. It didn't sound natural, like a human's breathing at all. It was almost like a low growl.
	
	Then came the screaming, it was so deafening. One would think the drawer would muffle the sound in some way but then again everything that's happening right now shouldn't be happening. I wanted to run for the door again, to get out of whatever the fuck this was but the black fog erupted in front of the door covering it completely. It didn't fill the room, it only hid the door.
	
	I tried forcing my hands through it and feeling for the handle, but I couldn't feel anything, the door should've been there but there was nothing. I reached out to my elbows and still nothing. The door should've been right there, my hand should've been going through it, it was that close. But nothing.
	
	The screaming had stopped. Instead, there was a loud bang and a dent in the door holding Ramirez back. Again and again, more dents grew in the door until it finally flew off into the black fog covered floor. A burst of fog came out before it slowly filtered out like before. I nearly cried out like a madman when I saw the glowing red eyes hiding in the chamber.
	
	They were staring me down looking right through me. It hurt. It hurt to have that thing look at me. I just wanted it to go away, to shut its eyes and stay dead like it was supposed to. But then it's claw-like hands latched onto the sides of the opening. Twisted, jagged claws scraping the sides. It leapt out and stood tall. I was a blubbering mess, it wasn't tears or screaming, I was losing my damn mind.
	
	Ramirez's stitching had been pulled apart and his chest opened. Inside was an orange glow and a black ribcage. I looked up to his face and only saw horns. They were about 6 inches long, curving back past his fringe. The tips were glowing yellow like molten steel.
	
	He stared me down and retrieved a strange stone. It was a circle, like a sigil covered in strange markings all glowing red. Ramirez then found a scalpel and jabbed it into his shoulder, drawing out blood which he then wiped across the circular shaped stone whilst muttering something.
	
	He returned attention to me. He threw the table in front of him away effortlessly while still staring into my eyes still.
	
	"I'm sorry... but I have to kill it." He said to me as his horns and body began glowing more violently. He kneeled down to me. I still couldn't breathe from the fog, I could see that he was breathing but could feel no breath. His teeth appeared sharpened and larger but none of that mattered.
	
	His hand buried itself into my chest, ripping into me. I somehow still remained conscious. My eyes fixated on the horrid sight, I realised he wasn't mindlessly tearing away at me, he was making an incision. The pain broke me. I was screaming so loud for help, for anyone who might hear me. Someone must've been on this level showing up for a shift or maybe a janitor just cleaning. Anybody. Ramirez had finished opening up my chest. He then plunged his hand into the wound and pulled out my heart.
	
	I began tasting iron in my mouth from all of the blood filling it. My clothes were stained red, the only reason I couldn't see the new red splattered floor was because of the fog but I felt it. For some reason, the pain stopped but I could still see everything. I thought I was dead. I think it might've been too much for my brain process.
	
	Suddenly a knocking could be heard from the door beyond the cool room. "Anybody in there? Hey is everything okay? Heard screamin!" A guard called out.
	
	Ramirez slashed at the door behind me opening it and dragging me into the light-filled hallway directly in front of a security guard. "Holy fuck!" He yelled drawing his gun. I was only able to mumble the words "Don't let him kill me." Before Ramirez dragged me into the Janitors closet and covered the door with fog.
	
	"IN HERE! SOMETHING TOOK HIM INTO THE JANITOR CLOSET!" I heard the guard screaming for his pal.
	
	Ramirez got busy he took the sigil and placed it into my chest. I began to feel pain again. Something felt odd. Like my insides were crawling towards the sigil stone. Soon enough my wound closed itself but there was still burning in my chest.
	
	Ramirez stood up proud almost with a crazed smile across his face, his wounds were all gone. The gaping hole in his chest was all but gone, replaced with actual flesh. His horns had faded away like the black fog covering the door. The guard was still banging loudly against the door.
	
	"I did not want to hurt anyone else today but there is no other way to kill it." He said calmly as the guard burst in with his gun out, Ramirez jabbed him with the scalpel in the eye, retrieved the revolver from the guard and let him squirm in pain as he held his hands close to his eye but not daring to touch the scalpel. Ramirez drew the gun on me. The other guard, however, shot Ramirez before he could pull the trigger on me.
	
	"Suspect down, I need medical help here please!" He called out over his radio. I was still in shock, I couldn't move or think, it was all blank space to me for what seemed like hours or days. The next clear memory I have is whispering. I was in a hospital bed, staring at the wall, listening to something whisper in my head. "It's you and me now if you died I would find another, but he made us one. If you die, I die. I'm hungry... if we're going to survive I need something from you. All I can do is give you the strength to do it. Find them, find the wicked we need to cull them from the shepherd's herd."
	
	I haven't been a doctor for years, but hunting is a lucrative business, it keeps me well-fed, strong, and the herd is a little safer from the wolves.
==================================================
Smoke Without A Fire

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dplw3j/smoke_without_a_fire/


	My fire alarm went off this morning. I was getting ready to leave for work - actually, I was rushing to leave for work because I had been lying in front of my fan heater, unwilling to go outside into the cold. My flat is in a poorly maintained Victorian building and only has cracked single glazing, so it’s always freezing, especially with the first frost of the year wrapping its fingers around Northern England.
	
	I’ve been finding it harder and harder to leave the flat in the mornings the past few weeks. I get up at five thirty in the morning and should head out soon after for the train but I always seem to find myself wrapped in a blanket in front of my little portable heater until the last possible minute.
	
	That’s what happened this morning. I looked at my watch and realised that I was already late for the first two trains I could catch, and if I didn’t want to be late for the third day in a row I would have to leave now. I was halfway out the door, briefcase in hand, when the alarm went off.
	
	For such an old, creaky building it’s one hell of an alarm. Imagine the worst migraine you’ve ever had, amplify it, and now imagine that pain is a sound. The landlord may not have double glazed the windows, but he certainly didn’t skimp on this alarm. The only problem was that I live in a three room apartment, and none of those rooms were on fire.
	
	I ran downstairs. The building’s alarms were all controlled from a central command box at the bottom of the stairs, and it had an LED display that showed which flat the alarm originated from. According to the box, mine was the only one on fire.
	
	I looked up the stairs. I could see into my apartment from where I stood, and it was very much not on fire. Sighing, I pressed the button to silence the alarm before it annoyed the other residents, and went back upstairs to grab my things for work and double check that the building was definitely not burning down.
	
	I missed the last early train, thanks to the weird not-fire. No one at work said anything, though. That was nice. I had a lot to do and usually everyone’s super chatty. I think I managed to go the whole day just slogging through my work, not making conversation.
	
	I guess it was a bit weird. Normally I’m the first to join in on the team banter and have a laugh, but the atmosphere just wasn’t there today. I guess sometimes adulting is just like that. Sometimes you laugh and joke and mess around with your friends, sometimes you eat lunch alone. The peace and quiet is nice, I suppose. Every once in a while.
	
	Things have been pretty quiet since I got home too. The alarm hasn’t gone off again, and my home is still very not on fire. If anything, the air feels damp, like someone has hidden a giant humidifier somewhere behind a door. And there’s a smell, though I can’t quite place it, sort of sickly and unpleasant. I’ve sent a text to the landlord, but he hasn’t replied yet. Probably busy. I’ll call him in the morning.
	
	I don’t really know why I’m posting this. I should be asleep right now, but every time I start to drift off I dream I can hear the fire alarm and wake right back up again. But everything’s quiet, despite the memory of the dream ripping through my head. It’s silent, really. Even the cats in the alley aren’t making any sound.
	
	I tried messaging my boyfriend just to pass the time while I wait to fall asleep again. I guess his phone must be on silent.
	
	I guess that’s why I’m posting here. It’s been a weird rough day and I want to tell someone about it. I know everyone has off days, but I feel isolated, like I’m behind a sheet of glass and nothing, not even sound can get in or out.
	
	Can anybody hear me?

	It wasn’t until the next day anyone came for me.
	
	Hours of me staring at the ceiling and trying to figure out what emotions were mine and which were Ragna’s when I heard the cell door open.  I could sense her there, staring at me, her confusion, her anger.  It wasn’t even anger directed at me, it was a self-loathing of sorts.
	
	“There’s some explaining you need to do,” Ragna forced a smile, “I don’t know why they’d lock you up for protecting my Rachel, but-”
	
	I stood up, and knew what to say to get things straightened out, “I love her.”
	
	Ragna’s smile vanished, “What?”
	
	“I said,” I walked right up to Ragna, getting right into her face, “I love Rachel, when I saw her today I fell in love with her.  Her eyes, even when they’re angry, the fire inside of them took hold of me and all I wanted to do was get lost inside of them.”
	
	Ragna’s shock faded and she regarded me, “How…?”
	
	“I don’t know?  You tell me!” I shouted.
	
	Ragna’s eyes grew wide, “Oh, oh dear.”
	
	“What did you do to me?!” I demanded.
	
	Ragna grabbed my shoulder, squeezing hard, reminding me of my place.
	
	I fell to my knees in pain.  A shiver went through me as her grip threatened to shatter my shoulder blade or at least dislocate my shoulder.  My stomach dropped as she held tight.
	
	“I’ve killed others for less.  I understand you’re upset, but,” she warned, “don’t push it.”
	
	“You’re inside my head messing with it, aren’t you?” I accused.
	
	Ragna shook her head, “No,” Ragna heaved a sigh, “I pushed my anger for Captain Sofia Vázquez into that vial, I hoped my hatred of *her* would transfer to *you*.  Nothing more.”
	
	“Well I hate that woman with every fiber of my being, just hearing her name makes me angry,” I looked up at her, “But I got more than your hatred.”
	
	“An error I won’t repeat,” Ragna let go of me, “I’m sorry Madison.  It was a rash thing to do.”
	
	“So now what? ” I said, getting to my feet.  Ragna’s feelings for Rachel were intense, it was hard to ignore them.
	
	Ragna was silent, deep in thought.
	
	Whatever was going on inside her mind, I hoped she was thinking of a solution.
	
	There were a few minutes of silence before I interrupted her, “So, ideas Ms.Wizard?”
	
	Ragna’s resolved cracked and she gave me a concerned look, “I can traipse about someone’s mind and change their thoughts, but what I did wasn’t rearranging memories, Madison, it was more subtle.  That’s why I thought it would not be so invasive.”  she grumbled, “This is something that requires someone with more empathy than anything else.  The only woman I know who could is Priestess Tasha.  She runs the Catholic Church here.”
	
	“I haven’t seen her since the princesses left,” I pointed out.
	
	“That figures,” Ragna stated, “I’ll set her sister, Xei, to seek her out but I am doubtful if that will bear fruit,” Ragna grimaced, “We will need to go outside of Penthesil for this.”
	
	“Outside?” I asked, an eyebrow raised.
	
	[…](https://www.trzcacak.rs/myfile/detail/248-2485080_omega-png-transparent-background-omega-symbol-png.png)
	
	We were outside the walls of Penthesil, where Ragna had called one of her mages.
	
	Standing before me was a tall bald man with vibrant green eyes.  He was athletic and wore a similar uniform as Syria and Alexis did.  I guess the mages had to match.  He peered into my eyes, holding my head in his hands.
	
	“If you keep doing that, I will ask you to buy me dinner,” I said, getting frustrated with being manhandled.
	
	“Ya aint me type, love,” a thick cockney accent confirmed.  “'eaven and 'ell this is a Elliot Ness, Mistress.”
	
	“Rasper, I do not need a ‘I told you so,’” Ragna protested.
	
	“Nah, yeah ya do!” Rasper, the man staring at me, shouted, “Wot did ya do ter this girl?”
	
	“I’m not a girl,” I growled.
	
	Rasper bopped my nose.
	
	My anger vanished, “I’m sorry…”
	
	“She’s loike a younger version of ya,” Rasper said, casting a glare at Ragna, “Science, genetics, engineering, telepathy, even nanomachines, that’s wot yer good at, Mistress.” Rasper pointed to me, “Wot the Gypsy Nell did ya try?”
	
	Ragna took a deep breath, “I pushed my hatred for a specific woman into a genetic treatment for her,” Ragna confessed.
	
	“Bloody ‘ell!” Rasper shouted, “Ya infused 'er wif your 'ate!  'eaven and 'ell why do ya 'ate 'er, if ya daan't mind me askin?”
	
	I had difficulty understanding half of what Rasper said.  It sounded like English, but it wasn’t.
	
	“That vile woman, Sofia,” even as Ragna said the name my blood boiled.
	
	Rasper booped my nose again and snapped me out of it.
	
	Ragna continued, “she and her team left Rachel bedridden!  A bullet ripped her apart!” Ragna growled, “it’s a miracle her uterus survived, but her digestive tract is in shambles, she lost a kidney, she’ll be shitting into a bag for the rest of her life!” Ragna regaled us, “and that horrid woman threatened to blow her head off!  She shoved a gun into Rachel’s mouth!” Ragna barely could calm herself, “I’ve never been so helpless.”
	
	“Okay, na ya wonder why this girl's got feelings for Rachel?  Wot, ya fin' your 'ate 'ad nah source?  It's the ovver side of the coin, Mistress, that bein' love!  They’re tied at the bloody 'ip!!”  Rasper grumbled.  “Ya cocked this up well and good.”
	
	“I’m seeing why my brother dislikes you, Rasper.” Ragna pointed out.
	
	“Ya kna why? it’s 'cause i’m right!” Rasper pointed out.
	
	Ragna looked away.
	
	“Can you fix me?” I asked.
	
	Rasper grumbled, “Love, Ya 'ave Bo-le Of Glue sets of emotions stuck in yer heart,” he explained, “Emotions 're strong and Ragna’s not dealin' wif weak ones ter start.”
	
	“So that’s a ‘no’?” I asked.
	
	Rasper sighed, “do ya love someone else?”
	
	My cheeks turned red, “I don’t know, to be honest.  It’s complicated.”
	
	Rasper grinned, “Oh?  Wait that I can work wif…”
	
	“Huh?” I asked, confused.
	
	Rasper looked to me, “This person, ya Bobby ya love them?”
	
	I recalled Hilly and me in bed my cheeks went red.  The answer was: I wasn’t sure.  If we met another way, perhaps, but despite me confronting Hilly, the rape still happened.
	
	“Oh na if that aint the cutest fin',” Rasper said smiling at me, “now I can fix this up in a jiffy, at least part of it. Ya still garn ter 'ate that Sofia woman, but we can at least get the bleedin' majority of your emotions wound up right 'ere.”  pink fire engulfed his finger and he tapped my forehead.
	
	My head spun and my stomach was in knots, it blew my head up like a balloon.  A moment later, everything seemed to slide back into place.
	
	“Okay, garn ter test this aahhht,” Rasper looked to me, “Queen Rachel?”
	
	I stared at him, her name didn’t elicit any response like before.
	
	“Good,” he smiled, “'oo were ya maybe in golden dove wif?”
	
	“Hilly?” I blushed, and my heart started to race thinking of her, “Oh…”
	
	“So, just so you’re aware, I didn’t tamper wif your thoughts. those 're your emotions, they’re just stronger. fin' of it loike this: ya had two cups of tea, one was strong, the other was… well, it was still tea.  Na they’re in the same cup, ya got me?” Rasper explained.
	
	“Why is it always tea with brits?” I asked.
	
	Rasper laughed, he then turned to Ragna, “Listen ter this one, she’s the chuffin' only wahn who’s gonna call yah’ aahht on yer bullshit.”
	
	Ragna turned to me, “Well… seems that makes you my advisor, Madison.”
	
	I cleared my throat, getting to my feet, “Okay.”
	
	Ragna faced Rasper, “Thank you, you can return to my brother.”
	
	Rasper grinned, “I was wonderin’ if I could ‘ead back to the men’s village fer a tic?”
	
	Ragna smiled, “Oh?  What’s his name?”
	
	Rasper’s cheeks reddened, “I… daan’t kna yet.”
	
	Ragna rolled her eyes, “have fun.”
	
	Rasper bowed and vanished in a puff of smoke.
	
	Ragna turned to me, “I have some armor to give you, and a bit of an apology.”
	
	“What?” I said, shocked.
	
	“Magic isn’t my strong suit,” Ragna admitted, “so far this is twice now I’ve used it and twice I’ve done undo harm.  I think I’m rather done with the stuff. For that, Madison, I apologize, I shouldn’t have used you as a guinea pig.  That Sofia woman…”
	
	“I know.  You said you were helpless,” I frowned, “I know what that’s like.”
	
	“Also my fault?”
	
	I gave Ragna a nod.
	
	Ragna’s face fell, “you’re the only person who knows this much about me outside of Rachel and my brother.” she looked to the gate leading back to Penthesil.  “I feel naked.”
	
	Did I have sympathy for Ragna?  I did my best to determine if this was my emotion or Ragna’s.  It was clearer to tell now.  Whatever Rasper had done, I now knew when the alien emotions were there. When I thought of Sofia I felt rage, but I knew it wasn’t my anger.
	
	“It’s funny,” Ragna chuckled, “I didn’t expect to find, dare I say, a friend?”
	
	I scoffed, “Yeah well, I expect perks if I’m friends with the empress of the world, right?”
	
	“Oh, is that how it is?” Ragna said, her smile growing.
	
	“Yes.  I want an island, at some point,” I joked.
	
	Ragna laughed, “You’ll settle for armor for now,” she motioned for me to follow her.
	
	…
	
	I was standing in the Palace basement, and while Ragna had trained me with weighted clothing, it was strange to wear full plate armor.
	
	I was like some kind of cosplayer at a renaissance fair. My hands flexed in the gauntlets, I noticed chainmail in between the joints.  Between me and the armor, I wore black stretchy fabric.  It was comfortable, though it bunched up around my neck.
	
	Ragna interjected, “the chainmail is also Crystalinum,” she smiled, turning to a short woman with jet-black hair.
	
	The woman was wearing a lab coat and had safety goggles on.  “Difficult to make, but not impossible!  Oh, the technology that Empress Ragna has imparted to us!”
	
	I picked up the helmet and slid it on, finding it had difficultly with my long hair.
	
	“I’m afraid you must cut it shorter Madison,” Ragna said, half a smile on her face.
	
	“Well, no offense, but I am not shaving my head!” I objected.
	
	Ragna slid her hand over the right side of her head, grinning, “Oh it’s so freeing Madison,” she chuckled.  I wondered if she braided the other side daily, as it was long but still thin towards the bottom.
	
	I got the helmet on, though it was tight.  The helmet closed around the front of my mouth, my eyes the only thing exposed.
	
	As I moved it surprised me how light the armor was, either this was a feature of the metal or my newfound physique.
	
	Ragna gave me a mischievous smile, “Why don’t you walk over this way, Madison?”
	
	I narrowed my eyes as she pointed to a firing range, “What are you up to?”
	
	“A field test.”
	
	I walked to where she pointed cautiously.  The armor did not inhibit my range of motion, though I would not be sneaking up on the enemy in any major way.
	
	“Head downrange, Maddy,” Ragna stated.
	
	“Sure thing Raggy,” I had to thank Rasper later, I felt like me again.
	
	As I turned to Ragna, she had a strange look on her face.  She wasn’t mad at my nickname nor did she seem happy.  She was lost in thought again, and I wondered if this was another moment she might think about letting me closer to her.  Strange as it was, I don’t think I ever met someone as walled up as Ragna was.  She had my sympathy.
	
	“Sorry, that was-”
	
	“No, I shouldn’t have,” Ragna smirked, “*Raggy…* is just… no.”
	
	“Do you have another preference?” I asked.
	
	Ragna paused, deep in thought.  I wished I could step inside her head.  Then again, after recalling what Devon said he saw, that might not be a good idea.  Visions of dead angels danced in my head, and I wondered still if Ragna has massacred all of heaven or just a small part of it.
	
	The woman in the lab coat walked over with a blast shield with something poking through it, “Ready your grace!”
	
	“Good, Madison, say ‘activate visor’ please?” Ragna asked.
	
	“Activate visor?” A blue haze came over everything.  It highlighted Ragna in green, as was the woman behind the blast shield.  “Looks like a video game,” I said as the visor highlighted the thing sticking through the blast shield in red.  “What’s that?”
	
	“Weapon hot!” The woman shouted.
	
	Ragna smiled, “Open fire.”
	
	A hail of bullets flew out of the barrel of the gun in front of me.  I thought I would die.  They shot out so quickly I didn’t have time to react.  They struck my breastplate, and I staggered back a bit before I regained my footing.  Bullet holes riddled the firing range around me.  I checked my chest, there wasn’t a scratch on the armor.
	
	“D-Did you just shoot a machine gun at me?!” I shouted.
	
	“Yes,” Ragna said with a sly grin.  “The visor is a force field, but it takes a lot to power, so only activate it during heavy fire.  The rest is some rather boring augmented reality.”
	
	I touched my chest plate, finding it cool, “Can I try something?”
	
	Ragna smiled, “Open fire.”
	
	This time I tried to trace the rounds.  It was difficult, but towards the end of the salvo, I blocked a stream of bullets with my wrists guards.  “Wonder Woman eat your heart out,” I said seeing some lead residue on the arm guards.
	
	“Who?” Ragna asked.
	
	“Oh, nothing,” I smiled, pulling the helmet off.  “All the soldiers are wearing this stuff?”
	
	Ragna nodded, “if you pull the fabric around your neck up to your nose, you’ll find a filter that will protect from any form of gas, if you drink water through it, the fabric will act as a filter.  The battery for your visor charges kinetically, still it’s best to leave it off until you take heavy fire.”
	
	“You thought of everything, huh?” I asked.
	
	“Just about,” Ragna turned as I saw Esmerelda walking towards her, “Perfect timing.”
	
	Esmerelda bowed, “Mistress, I have what you requested.”  Esmerelda offered a sword.
	
	The blade looked rough, the edges were jagged like cut glass, the entire length black. Steam slid off the surface.
	
	Eris’s voice was back again, “oh my what… is that lovely thing?”
	
	Eris floating over my shoulder startled me, “finished with Eurybia?”
	
	Esmerelda responded to Eris, to my shock, “a blade forged of chaos energy, Spirit of Discord.”
	
	“Oh, please call me Eris you slut-on-steroids,” Eris spat, “gimmie gimmie gimmie!”
	
	Esmerelda turned to Ragna, “My mistress, are you certain about… *her*?”
	
	Ragna nodded, “Yes,” she turned to me, offering the sword’s handle.  “Two qualities of this sword make it unique. Care to explain, Esmerelda?”
	
	Eris’s eyes were wide as saucers as I took the blade in my hand.  “Oh, I must…” she touched the blade, it’s blade changed to white and gold, the steam now yellow as a result, “ooooh that’s the good stuff!” Eris tittered and cooed as if she was getting high off a drug.
	
	Esmerelda rolled her eyes, “Anyone struck by this blade will suffer a bout of chaos. They will lose their minds.  If you plunge this blade into the heart of an angel, it can kill them.  No need to remove their wings.”
	
	I looked to Ragna, “Wait, why would I need that?”
	
	“Captain Sofia Vázquez is an Angel, a Nephilim, but still an Angel.  She’s an Avatar of Samael.”
	
	Eris’s eyes went wide and she recoiled from the sword, “Samael...” she whispered in fear.
	
	I frowned, “What is Samael?”
	
	Eris slinked to my other shoulder, “The Venom of God,” she hissed.
	
	“A powerful angel of God, but there’s a weakness,” Ragna pointed out, “Sofia is a Terran to start, and her mind is weak and blind.  While I’m sure Samael has pushed her to the brink of madness, a strike from this could force her over the edge.”
	
	I nodded, looking at the sword in my hand, “So, use this to kill her or drive her insane then?”
	
	“Correct,” Ragna stated.
	
	“When do I get the chance to kill her?”
	
	“Patience, Captain.”  Ragna began, “Our first target will be the softest one, Caracas.  Killing their head of state will be up to you.”
	
	“Can’t we just imprison them?  Must we kill them?”
	
	“This man has little redemption in him Madison, but I'll leave it to your discretion.  Imprison him, or kill him, either way, we remove him from power and take the country,” Ragna advised.
	
	I sheathed the sword, getting a feel for the armor, “mind if I wear this home?”
	
	Ragna smiled, “go ahead.”
	
	…
	
	If I didn’t turn heads before, I was turning them now.  I heard whispers and got the occasional accusatory glance.
	
	I should mention, on the back of my armor was a symbol of Eris.  A Discordian regimen was unheard of.
	
	When I got home, I caught Hilly on her way out, she was in her red royal guard uniform.  She gave me a hungry gaze, “Wow, aren’t we a pair?”
	
	I closed the door behind me.  I did not understand how to face Hilly now, even with my emotions sorted out.  Rasper was right, my feelings for Hilly were amplified.  My heart was hammering in my chest and I couldn’t believe what I had done the night before.
	
	“Maddy?”
	
	“Huh?” I turned to see her coming in for a kiss.
	
	I stopped her “I’m sorry if I was… fast, before,” I blushed, “things got mixed up in my head and-”
	
	She placed her finger to my lips.  “It’s fine,” she grinned, “I will not lie, I kind of enjoyed you being forceful.  Maybe something we could play with later?  I just, well, I didn’t want you to be all anger.”
	
	I tried to change the subject, “So, where are you off to?”
	
	Hilly sighed, “Well, The Queen wants her wedding tomorrow.”
	
	“Tomorrow? She could barely walk yesterday!”
	
	“Well,” Hilly began, “tomorrow is when she wants it.”
	
	“Talk about demanding,” I looked to the door, wondering if Hilly would leave soon.  I hadn’t felt this conflicted since the day after she raped me.  That thought sent me for a loop, to say the least, and I felt sick.
	
	“Want to meet me there tomorrow?  I’ll make sure you have a ticket,” Hilly said as she stood at the door.
	
	“Sure,” I forced a smile, “we can meet up.”
	
	“Well, I’ll be back later, so you can wait for dinner. Oh,” she blushed, “I guess you’re not my Hestie anymore.”
	
	“I haven’t forgotten how to cook,” I reminded.
	
	“Okay,” Hilly beamed.
	
	Her smile was so adorable, “Love you.” I said before I could stop myself.  My stomach was in my feet and I slapped my hand over my mouth.  Damn you Rasper!
	
	“I,” Hilly’s cheeks darkened, “l-love you too, Maddy.”
	
	She lingered in the doorway.
	
	“I-I’m sorry that just…” my cheeks were burning, “slipped out.”
	
	Hilly’s cheeks were just as red, “I’ll see you later?”
	
	“Later,” I promised.
	
	Hilly left and I swallowed the lump in my throat, “just tossing out the ‘I love you’ whenever…” I scolded myself.  I gave my forehead a good thunk, “Damn it.”
	
	The house phone rang, I picked it up, “hello?”
	
	“Madison,” the word almost sounded like a soldier in my head as Ragna said it. .
	
	“Oh, Ragna, hi,” I wasn’t sure how I should address her.
	
	“I will assume you heard about the wedding tomorrow?” She asked.
	
	“Yes,” I confirmed.
	
	“Good.  Rachel is insistent we wed as soon as possible so, that’s the current situation.”
	
	“So it would seem,” I was curious where this was going, “Ragna, why are you calling?”
	
	There was a moment of silence, “it’s customary for a wedding to include more than just a bride and a groom, there’s a wedding party of sorts, from what I gather.”
	
	“Yeah” I humored her, “The ladies have a bridal party with a maid of honor and the men have a ‘best man’ with their groomsmen.”
	
	“Yes, that is what I understand.  There’s no formal ceremony here in Penthesil, Rachel’s been demanding we follow the tradition you described,” Ragna continued.
	
	“Are you getting cold feet or something?” I asked.
	
	“No!” Ragna defended, “I want to marry Rachel more than anything.”
	
	“You just sound nervous,” I pointed out.
	
	Ragna paused for some time, “It’s an aspect of the wedding I am unsure of.”
	
	“What’s that?”
	
	“I don’t have,” Ragna paused again, “what was it you said, a ‘Best Man’, or a ‘Best Woman’ in this case.”
	
	“I’ve seen weddings where the groom is alone,” I thought of the last time I had seen such a thing.  My uncle got married alone, granted his bride was 30 years his junior.
	
	“As it stands the parties are lopsided.  Rachel has requested Launa as her Maid of Honor,” Ragna continued.
	
	“That’s nice!  I’m happy that those two are still friends,” I wondered if Launa would get into a bridesmaid’s dress.
	
	Ragna was silent for another moment or two, “Be my ‘Best woman’?”
	
	It shocked me, “I… what?”
	
	“Would You Be My Best Woman?” Ragna asked again.
	
	I stared at the wall flabbergasted.
	
	“Madison?” Ragna asked, “Did I lose you?”
	
	“N-no! No, just, I… I’m stunned is all,” I managed, “I mean-”
	
	“You’re the only friend I have, who’s a woman.  I could ask Syria or Alexis but they’re servants,” Ragna’s pause seemed to have something snapping in the background, “You are not.”
	
	“I’ll… sure, yes, I can be your woman of honor,” I answered.
	
	Ragna’s voice shifted and I could hear the relief wash over her, “Thank you.”
	
	“Was I your first choice?” I said smiling over the phone.
	
	“Madison,” Ragna assured, “You’re my only choice.
	
	…
	
	I’ve been a bridesmaid once before.  I’ve not been a ‘best woman’ before.  I wore
	
	ceremonial armor rather than a tux.  Ragna and I stood at the steps of the throne, the nun, Sister Catherine, or Fatima, whichever she was going by today, stood behind us.
	
	Ragna was wearing something like her normal armor, polished to a high sheen and her cape was silver rather than blue.  Despite the occasion, Ragna wore no make-up.
	
	Ragna leaned over to me, “You have the ring, yes?”
	
	I nodded, motioning to a box in my hand, “guarding it with my life.”
	
	Ragna nodded.
	
	“Nervous?” I asked.
	
	“Excited,” Ragna said. “I haven’t seen Rachel since the treatment. She demanded it.”
	
	“Treatment?” I asked.
	
	Music started to play as Launa made her way down the aisle, which was in the middle of the royal court.  She wore a lovely silver dress that showed off her curves well.  It surprised me, as most bridesmaid’s dresses seem like attempts to make the bridesmaids seem as homely as possible when compared to the bride.
	
	Launa took her place and waved at me.
	
	I waved back before louder music began.  I turned my attention to the front of the room as Rachel made her way towards us.
	
	She looked ten years younger, if not more.  I thought it was make-up but as she strode towards us in time with the music it was clear something had changed.  Rachel’s wings were bright silver now, shimmering as if they were metallic.
	
	The dress she wore was white with intricate silver lines woven into the veil and fabric. The dress was strapless and backless, with a long train behind her.  She wasn’t carrying any flowers, but walked confidently up to the steps, taking Ragna’s offered hand.
	
	Ragna removed the veil, and that’s when I noticed the biggest change in Rachel.
	
	Rachel’s eyes were glowing blue now, her iris’s acting like pulsing LED lights.  Nothing about her eyes seemed organic, as if her eyes were replaced with some kind of false eye.  Yet they still focused, shifted, and moved like real eyes.
	
	My stomach dropped, and I was more than a bit disturbed.  What had ‘The Treatment’ done?  How extreme was it?  Ragna had no qualms about forcing her emotions into me, yet she was apprehensive about this treatment.
	
	Ragna’s hand caressed her cheek, “how are you feeling?”
	
	“Flawless,” Rachel said, smiling.
	
	I noticed the silver parts of her dress were moving within the fabric, shifting and sliding back and forth, almost like trails of silver sand in motion.  Was this the dress, or the treatment?
	
	Rachel grinned, “today, a wedding, tomorrow, a war.”
	
	Ragna nodded, turning to Sister Fatima, “you can begin, Fatima.”
	
	Weddings are dull, this was no exception.  Though the kiss between them was deep and passionate.  I couldn’t help but smile when they finally got to that part.  The court erupted in applause, but I could tell neither of them could hear any of us.  They were lost in each other’s embrace, and I had to admit, despite Rachel’s changes, it was beautiful.
	
	Launa was in tears, the happy sort.
	
	…
	
	Hilly joined me at the wedding party table, Ragna and Rachel were dancing after all the speeches.  “Busy day?” Hilly asked.
	
	I nodded, drinking another glass of sparkling cider, “Yeah.”
	
	“How did you get in this good with the Empress?” she asked.
	
	I chuckled, “Training.”
	
	Off to the side, I saw Sister Fatima speaking to that Syria woman.
	
	“Those two close?” I asked.
	
	Hilly looked at the pair, they were out of sight from most, “Maybe?”
	
	Syria got down on one knee.
	
	“Oh,” Hilly said, eyes wide.
	
	I couldn’t help but smile, “I guess so.”
	
	Syria slid a ring onto Sister Fatima’s finger, and the pair embraced.
	
	“Love’s in the air,” I said.
	
	Hilly laughed.
	
	I turned to Hilly, “So, between the two of us...”
	
	Hilly blushed, looking to the dance floor, “I don’t think we need anything formal, do you?”
	
	I shook my head, “I’d like… to start over.”
	
	“Me too,” Hilly kept her eyes on the dance floor.  “As much as I asked you before I never thought you’d say ‘yes’.  The ‘I love you’ was,” she turned to me, “I thought about Maria a lot today.”
	
	“Yesterday must have been a complete blind-side,” I sighed.
	
	Hilly grinned, “a little, but it was a welcome surprise.”
	
	I wasn’t sure where to go from there, but my heart was aching for what I had planned to say next, “Tomorrow is the start of a war.”
	
	“Don’t think about it,” Hilly suggested.
	
	“I kind of have to,” I looked to her, “I might not come back.”
	
	HIlly’s face fell.
	
	“If that’s the case, I don’t know if starting something new with you is fair,” my heart sank.
	
	HIlly faced me, “Maddy if you don’t come back, I don’t want to live with regret.” She took my hand, “You want to start over, right?”
	
	I looked up to her, and her sweet pleading eyes.  Oh God, my heart!  The look on her face just took hold of me.  “Yes.”
	
	“Then let's go home together, and see what happens?”
	
	When we got home, we talked for hours about everything and anything.  Hilly fell asleep on me, and I couldn’t sleep for a single second.  I cradled her against me staring at the ceiling, wondering what war was like, what to expect.  Would I come home?  What would Hilly do if I didn’t?  I looked to her sleeping face, and she looked so innocent.  Hate me if you want, but damn it, I love this woman.  ‘Enhanced’ emotion or not, I was coming home to her, and I didn’t care who I crushed on the way.
	
	I forgave her that morning for what she did to me those years ago.  After all, we're starting over, right?
	
	…
	
	I stood before a group of thirty soldiers, all Discordian.
	
	Eurybia held a large banner of the golden apple of Eris up by a metal post above us.  Eurybia was clad in golden armor.  Her helmet covered her face down to her nose, leaving only one slit for her eye, exposing her cheek. The other half of the helm looked broken, exposing her eye.  Every part of the armor’s designs, from the style of gauntlets to the boots were asymmetrical.
	
	The rest of us wore our jet-black armor.  I had a gun on my back, my sword at my side.
	
	Eurybia grinned, “I’m so happy to be marching with you!” Eurybia was downright giddy.
	
	“I’ll watch your back, don’t worry,” I assured.
	
	The Discordians were the vanguard, to our right was a couple of hundred soldiers.
	
	Ragna stood before all of us in her fighting armor, her wings hidden behind her cape.
	
	Rachel landed next to Ragna. Her silver wings folded or rather melted into her back, covering her body in silver armor that seemed to shift and move like a fluid.  Rachel’s mere appearance made me apprehensive, I was unsure of what she was anymore.  She turned to Ragna.
	
	Ragna shouted, “We march against a government that has starved their people, lied to them, and shot them in the street like dogs!”
	
	The army booed and hissed.
	
	“We will march to the capitol, and strike at the heart of their government,” Ragna looked to me.
	
	Ragna commanded, “those who stand for this government are evil men who enjoy the corruption sown by their leader!  Show them no mercy!”
	
	The soldiers all gave hoots and powerful shouts of approval.
	
	“This is the first of many nations who will fall, and rise greater than they ever could before!” Ragna shouted.  Ragna turned to me, “At your command captain.”
	
	Esmerelda stood before us, opening a portal to a city.  I was shaking inside as I glanced to my regimen.  Eurybia had suggested the name of our unit, and with the black armor, I thought it was fitting: The Daughters of Darkness.
	
	The goal is chaos, discord, and conquest.  I’m only targeting guys with guns and those in the government.  So if you’re there, don’t go into work today, and if you’re in power, hide or give it up!
	
	We’re coming for you.  So don’t resist!  Or else you will see what happens when you force us to get violent.

The real life counterpart to the SCP Foundation

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpl73z/the_real_life_counterpart_to_the_scp_foundation/


	My name is John, John Burkes. You might know me from my son's story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dacy7x/my_childhood_imaginary_friend_came_back_and_he/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), and if you're wondering, yes I'm dead. I *am* a doctor, not on Alzheimers though, as my son thought. I'm a scientist on the real life counterpart of the SCP Foundation.  I used the "Dr." title to trick people into thinking I'm a doctor. I'm glad my son is finally at peace. He figured it out himself! Now it's *my* turn.
	
	I've been stuck here for longer than I lived as a physical being. Last time I counted I was here for 1,450 days. I don't age, but the agency does. By agency I mean the "SCP Foundation." Here it't name is the *"最も暗い秘密" (Mottomo kurai himitsu)* which means, the darkest secrets. Pretty unoriginal huh? Well to be fair this is all in ***"My" World.*** Like Carlton, this is all fake. In my "imagination" or maybe it's Satan's playhouse. I did this containment breach just so I could see what will happen. If a huge facility like that lose power, you'd think it would have a good protocol. I destroyed it all. I can't seem to find peace and move on with Carlton. Anyways back to the experience...
	
	
	
	It has been a week or so now, no one in sight. Also a strange think I've taken note of is no **"specimens"** in sight. It's strange but I'm not complaining. As I move on towards the end of the hall, *drip drip drip* a skinwalker. It was right in front of me. I forgot we had these damn things in here. We made sure they were blind ; they can only hear and feel. It was for saftey protocols and so we could "test" on them easier.
	
	I had 2 options, *run to the other end of the hall, hence getting further from the "exit"* or *stay completely still.* The fuck did I choose? I *ran,* as fast as I can. I was nearing the end of the hall till I hear giggling. Pretty fucking creepy. Whatever it was though, it wasn't a bad creature. It was a little girl. She was smiling and was following me, matching my pace. Whilst all this, the damn skinwalker was accelerating. I asked, "can you get that damn thing away from me?" I knew this "specimen" was one of the good ones so I gave it a shot. She just nodded and turned into a fucking spider. Yes, you heard me, ***A FUCKING SPIDER.*** She killed the skinwalker in a flash, then turned back into the cute little girl.
	
	I asked her if she wanted anything in return, she just *hugged* me? In this akward ass situation I'm in I just hugged back. Then she just disappeared into thin air. What thw fuck is up with the creatures here, I swear.
	
	*(Transition to after an hour or so)..*
	As I'm nearing the exit, I come across a hallway that splits into 2 ways. One saying "Exit" and the other to "Specimen 001 ---&gt;". The answer was easy of course to the exit. The longer I walked deeper into the Exit route, blood. *Blood* was everywhere. Smeared on the walls. Then the intercom (the fuck?) turned on. ***"I see that you made it far. You're close to the end. You'll meet your boy sooner or later. Just a little test though..."***
	
	Follwed that demonic ass screams behind me. Yep, demonic ***FUCKING*** screams behind me. I bolted my ass to the exit. Yet the exit was no where to be found. I shouted *"God damnit Satan the fuck do you want?"*
	
	*"I wanna see you die duh."* That damn Lucifer replied.
	
	*"What happens if I die?"* I responded while trying to gasp for air (even if (for some reason) I wasn't tired).
	
	*"I don't really know actually."* Lucifer said mockingly.
	
	*"Fine I'll see what the demon (probably) thing looks like."* I said as I stopped running.
	
	What followed was the little cute girl from a while ago. She just gave me a hug. *"YOU HAPPY NOW?"* I shouted.
	
	*"Well, uhhhh that wasn't what I expected. Well you're free now see that Carlton boy of yours I guess."* Satan replied with a embarassed (who knew Satan would get embarassed) tone in his voice.
	
	Then out of no where the door just appeared. To some "heavenly" place. That's where I'm typing this. My son Carlton whom I haven't seen in years oh I miss him. I still don't know causing chaos in the facili— **OH.** He just wanted to see me do evil damn you. Well looks like I'm going to hell soon. I think for now I'll ask if I could wait for Charlotte and Charlie. I hope they read this as well.
==================================================
Where to begin

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpl34x/where_to_begin/


	Adrenaline. Adrenaline and fear. Fear? I'm not even sure I understand that word anymore. I'm not even sure I find this line of work satisfying, or if I ever did, i just stumbled upon it. A calling you could say, or fate, destiny, honestly anything.
	
	After what feels like a lifetime of doing this, but only around 3 years, I felt like I should start chronicling my work. I'm not sure if anyone will read this, and if they do, whether they'll choose to believe, or call me a madman. To be honest I'm not phased either way.
	
	Right now I'm standing in front of what was once a young vampire.... relatively speaking. He put up one hell of a fight, I'll be feeling a bit worse for wear tomorrow, but at least I've dealt with the issue. Not the way I like to deal with issues like this, but sometimes you just have to pray and spray the stake minigun.
	
	To explain why I just littered an alleyway with blessed splinters, I guess I need to delve back a little bit, 4 years ago, when I felt much younger.
	
	I was out on a midnight stroll, it was quite warm if I'm honest, full moon was out and I just had a compulsion to leave the house in my work gear, and walk the park. I'd normally walk this route after work daily, I was an electrician so I always had some pliers, screwdrivers and at least 14 different tiny things that no doubt would ruin my washing machine later that night.
	
	I rounded the corner near the local 24/7 emergency room, it was pretty quiet, it was a wednesday after all. There wasnt much sound, the birds had gone to sleep, the occasional cricket chirped happily enough, and if I really strained my ears I could hear morepork in the forest not far from here. Strangely enough I could also hear some kind of growling/ whimpering towards the centre of the park. Being in a relatively low crime area with plenty of lights around I headed in, figured I'd help out a dog in need if I could.
	
	As I rounded the Bush line that breaks the dog walking tracks from the incredibly maintained gardens I saw something that made me think I must have been having one hell of a lucid dream. It was a man, a man I knew. Not a best friend or anything, fellow tradie. He was a plumber, Jack was his name. I rushed over to him and quickly dropped to the grass, it was already wet with overnight dew.
	
	He wasnt bleeding, no bruising or anything.
	
	"Jack mate, what the hell happened?"
	
	Expecting a brief story about how he had a fight with his housemate and ended up drunk in the park, so when he turned to face me, seeing his eyes, usually a light blue, a deep amber, kind of made me double take a little bit.
	
	"Run you dumbass!"
	
	Ever the poet there, Jack.
	
	I stood up, and said a few words I never really thought I would say.
	
	"You're a werewolf? Holy shit dude!" I was metaphorically shitting myself, thinking what the hell I could do to help him and or stop him eating the hobos around the ER.
	
	I did something a little part of me had wanted to do since he cut some of my cables as a prank, took me 2 days to fix that fuck up, serves me right for putting a screw into his hot water pipes i suppose 🤣. I took a step back and with a nice size 10 steel capped boot, threw my weight behind a kick straight to his jaw, assuming it would either knock him out, kill him or stop him transforming.
	
	Well it did neither, and I can assure you, a half transformed werewolf that's just been kicked in the jaw is not exactly the best recipe for a wonderfully calm evening.
	
	The next part is where I lost track. Jack, now 8 feet tall, covered in dark fur, generic werewolf look about him, lifted me off the ground in a tackle that would make most rugby players recieve a red card, instead he drove me into the ground. I thought I was going to die right then, I couldn't breathe, stars in front of my eyes. As quickly as it started though, he stopped. Eyes wide open, no sound coming out of his mouth.
	
	Turns out werewolves are weak to silver, but not in the traditional sense. Itll strip them of their aggression and urge to kill almost anything (rabbits beware).
	
	He rolled off me, unconcious and completely naked, now human again. I fireman carried his naked ass back to my place and put him on the couch. Dont ask me why I kept the solid silver screwdriver my boss gave me as a congratulations for becoming qualified, but I'm bloody glad I did.
	
	I dont have much time left, I can hear the police sirens now, and I dont exactly want to be seen with a splinter mini gun in a dark alley on a Wednesday night, people might start thinking I'm weird.
	
	I'll fill you in on how I got to here and what my next mission is shortly, but for now stay safe, stay smart and by god, if you're in a crowded bar and hear your name being called, keep your head down. You'll thank me later.
==================================================
I have one job. And I’m very good at it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpl1ab/i_have_one_job_and_im_very_good_at_it/


	I have one job. And I’m very good at it.
	
	There are *monsters* that linger on the periphery of our society. Monsters that thrive off of chaos. From literal monsters that threaten the safety of the world to hungry children stealing food from local grocers. The circumstances never matter to me. In every instance, I act the same. If you break the rules, you are a monster. And monsters must be hunted.
	
	My name is Tom Lelaps. I hunt monsters. I *exist* for this one reason; this one purpose.
	
	Someone once compared what I do to that of a *guardian angel*. But they were wrong. Someone else once called me a *monster*. But they were wrong, too. I have no desire to hurt you. I have no desire to protect you. *Intent* is not in my vocabulary. I have but one function. One rule. And one must never break the rules.
	
	Which brings us to my current target: Father Jerry Cadmean
	
	Father Cadmean is a priest who’s killed dozens of people in the past 6 years. His killings have always been sporadic and brutal. He seemed to pick his victims on a whim, without rhyme or reason. Which is why the officers who worked his murders could never pick up a trend.  He’s one of the world’s most prolific serial killers, and yet no one even knows he exists.
	
	But I knew. He had popped up on my radar around 5 years ago. And I’ve been hunting him down ever since.
	
	He did have a knack for staying off the grid, however. Thus, why our game of cat and mouse has lasted as long as it has. But as I said before, I do my job very well. So it was always going to end this way.
	
	When I discovered Father Cadmean had been hospitalized at a small community hospital in rural Louisiana, I dropped everything and rushed here immediately. I knew he never stayed in one place for long and he had slipped through my fingers before.
	
	When I arrived, I found a fragile Father Cadmean, still in his religious **habit**, unconscious and on a ventilator in the ICU. He’s here now and is the only patient in the unit. His story prior to admission is still unknown.
	
	His doctor, a Dr. Tim Essien, is an older, stoic gentleman, who rarely left Father Cadmean’s bedside. He’s informed me of Cadmean’s poor prognosis, stating that his organs had shut down and that his condition is slowly becoming unstable.
	
	Per Dr. Essien, no one has been able to slow the rapid progression of Cadmean’s symptoms and that, in his medical opinion, he doesn’t think Cadmean will survive the night.
	
	His words triggered feelings of satisfaction and completeness. *The serial killer had been stopped. His death was practically a guarantee*. I studied the priest’s motionless silhouette for a moment. *My job was done. And it was done well.*
	
	My eyes then land on Cadmean’s nightstand. Atop of which lied what appeared to be a journal. Silver letters were scribbled on the outside fold. They read: ***Not all those who wander are lost***
	
	I flip through the pages and find myself reading a morbid auto-biography of Father Cadmean’s life. It, alone, is shocking enough, but it was only after I finished reading did I perceive an even scarier truth in within these pages.
	
	I’ve decided to post a few excerpts from the journal here. In a place where people believe the unbelievable. So if anything in this journal sparks something in your memory, anything you’ve maybe seen in the news, you should tell me.
	
	Because I have only one job. I can *do* only one thing. And, if what this journal is suggesting is true, then that job is not yet finished.

	**06JUNE2013 @ 19:06**
	
	Today in confession, I met a man who wasn’t there.
	
	I didn’t see him walk in, but I could somehow make out his silhouette in the darkness. That and his smirk. But absolutely nothing else. Not the rest of his face. Not the waLl between us. Not even my own hands held out in front of me. It’s like nothing else in the universe existed. Nothing except for me, this man, and his smirk.
	
	“Bless me father, for I have sinned,” he finally said. His low pitched voice seemed to vibrate the darkness itself. I carefully responded; asked him when he’d last had confession. He simply replied, “Feels like an eternity ago.”
	
	We chatted for a bit, but for the life of me I can’t seem to remember exactly what was said. Something about free will? Or rules? I’m not sure. All I remember from the chat was that it was incredibly *thrilling*.
	
	I left my side of the confessional and stood oUtside of his stall, wanting to embrace the stranger. I was the one tasked to offer penance yet I was the one who’d left that dialogue feeling *enlightened* and so filled with… *puRpose*.
	
	But he never came out and I never saw him leave. I pushed his curtain to the side. It was empty.
	
	I would’ve sworn I’d met a man today. But that man wasn’t there.
	
	**19MAR2014@ 06:33**
	
	Do you think we get what we desErve?
	
	Yesterday in confessional, I counseled a married, middle aged overweight gentleman who apparently enjoyed showering himself in cheap cologne. He was a curt and unruly gentleman and, for some reason, just his presence made me feel ill.
	
	“Forgive me faTher, for I have sinned.”
	
	It isn’t fair to completely blame this fellow for the way I was feeling. I’ve felt progressively uncomfortable inside my own skin ever since I met that other gentleman last year. The one that wasn’t there.
	
	“Confess your sins, my son, so that I may grant you peace,” I offered in a warm, but practiced tone.
	
	“Recently, I met this fine piece of as-,”
	
	“Language, my son. We’re in the house of the L0rd.”
	
	“My apologies, Father. So I met this young woman the other day. And we’ve made an arrangement. She’s agreed to be my *friend*. And I agreed to pay for her schooling.”
	
	“Are you confessing to both adultery and soliciting a prostitute, my son?”
	
	“No Father, this is different. We’re just *friends with benefits*. It’s a thing. I’ve also been getting her to do *other* things, too. You’d be surprised how much people will do for cash. I’ve actually given her a list of *rules* to follow. Want to hear about it?”
	
	For soMe reason, my body shuddered at the mention of the word *rule*.
	
	He went on for some time detailing all the gruesome and disgusting acts he’d have this *friend with benefits* perform. I nearly lost my lunch.
	
	Usually I would have ended the session there and encouraged the fellow to seek psychiatric counseling. However, this time I found myself opting for a different route.
	
	I didn’t interrupt or comment, I just quietly listened to every disgusting detail. And, after he finisHed, I completed the atonement and politely ushered the gentleman out of the church. Before he left, I made sure to acquire his contact information for the church’s community service project next month.
	
	If he had come to church more often, he’d have known that that project was actually last month.
	
	.
	
	I didn’t mEan to kill him. It sort of just happened.
	
	When I’d arrived at his home yesterday evening, I had thought no one would be home. In confession, he’d stated his wife was out of town and that he’d be out running errands for the rest of the day.
	
	But, casually lying on the floor in the living room, was a young woman dressed in minimal clothing and covered in bruises. At first, I thought she was unconscious as there were empty bottles of alcohol surrounding her. It wasn’t until I checked for a pulse did I realize that that wasn’t the case.
	
	Ok, so maybe I did mean to kill him.
	
	Armed with a serRated knife I found in the kitchen, I hid in one of the shadows. My dark habit garments aided in my camouflage within the darkness.
	
	I heard him enter the house. As I expected, he’d walked straight past the living room with the dead body, and went to the kitchen, straight to the fridge. As he opened the door of the fridge, my body practically moved on its own.
	
	I left the shadows for the briEfest of moments, and, in one swift motion, brought the blade to his jugular with an almost practiced efficiency. As streams of blood pulsated across the kitchen it mixed in with the entering moonlight, casting a lovely crimson tint over the room. I took in the sight and then disappeared back into the shadows.
	
	As I made my way back to the church, I waited for remorse or regret to hit me, but it never came. It still hasn’t. But I do feel something else brewing. Something deep inside of my being starting to bubble itself to the surface. Something that I’ve never felt before. The best way I can describe it is that it feels liKe ‘coming home for the first time’.
	
	I made it to the church’s front entrance, but before I entered, I looked up at the stars.
	
	I had an overwhelming feeling that all of this -- all of us here, every star, and every planet; it's all for nothing. Our lives are just commercials, playing inside a theater for an audience that was never there.
	
	Whatever I previously thought had defined me was just a story I’d been telling myself. If God did exist, He wouldn't care if I was a priest, an adulterer…
	
	Or even a murderer.
	
	The man I was before was no longer there. No longer a man of the cloth. I was free. Free to become anything else. Free to fInd a new purpose. A new meaning to this meaningless existence we call life.
	
	I have 4 people scheduled for confession tomorrow. I wondered if this question afflicted the deepest parts of them as well.
	
	I’ll be sure to check.
	
	**08SEPT2017 @ 10:00**
	
	The church burned down today.
	
	I’ve taken confessional for aLmost a decade now. I have seen enough guilt and shame and pain and lust and loneliness in that damned confessional booth to last me a dozen lifetimes. I've learned that many lost souls aimLessly wander this Earth. All searching for answers that’ll never come. All seeking a purpose they may never find.
	
	The church burned down today.
	
	Since the dawn of man, humanity has been searching for the answer to that one single unchanging quesTion: *what is my purpose?* I have a luxury that most do not. Because you see, thanks to the man that wasn’t there all those years ago, I now *know* my purpose.
	
	The church burned down today.
	
	I have seen the worst of humanity. I have experienced true misery. And I’ve learned that misery is bred from bondage. It’s simple biology. Inside the walls of a closed off system, chaos will ensue. But what would happen if one would tear down those walls? What would we do then?? How would we use our freshly minted freedOM!?
	
	The church burned down today.
	
	This will be my last entry. Whoever finds this journal, I hope you, too, find your purpose. And I hope that it satisfies you. Because if you do find that purpose, and you discover that it isn’t as gratifying or as fulfilling, as mine is…
	
	..then I expect I’ll be seeing you shortly.
	
	The church burned down today.
	
	Such a shame, really.
	
	\---
	
	So you see. This monster had a partner. Or a mentor maybe? Some man he mentioned in the beginning. Someone who looks to have started ALL of this.
	
	I had wanted to ask Dr. Essien if he had any information about how Father Cadmean had come in to the hospital, hoping it would maybe give me a lead on this ‘*man who wasn’t there*’, but I couldn’t find him. Would’ve sworn he was just at Cadmean’s bedside. But he wasn’t there when I looked a second ago.
	
	So all that’s left is you guys. All of Father Cadmean’s killings occurred in Southern Louisiana. If you have any information about these killings or about the *‘man that wasn’t there’*, anything at all, let me know through here. Please! I have only this one job. I can *do* only this one thing. Help me hunt this guy down.
	
	\---
	
	EDIT: Father Cadmean missing! After I finished typing this, I’d went back to check on him, but he wasn’t there! His bed was empty! I rushed back to the nursing station to report him missing, but they report never even having a patient named Father Cadmean. In fact, they say that that wing of the hospital has been shut down for some time.
	
	Did he get better? Was he ever even sick? Why would he set all this up?
	
	I’m not sure what’s going on, but I got a bad feeling about all of this.
	
	Someone… ANY one… please…
	
	Help me…
==================================================
I had a horrifying experience in the McDonald's drive-through

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpkkyk/i_had_a_horrifying_experience_in_the_mcdonalds/


	“Hello?” I yelled into the drive-through speaker.
	
	Growing impatient, I put my window all the way down and slumped my head outside the car. “Hellooooo?”
	
	“Stop doing that. You look stupid,” Mick said, lying back on my passenger seat with his eyes halfway closed.
	
	It was about 1:00 AM and we were the only car in that McDonald’s drive-through, but we didn’t care. I mean, they made these places open 24 hours specifically for people like Mick and I.
	
	“Captivating.”
	
	“What?” I replied to Mick, barely turning my head to look at him.
	
	He made a little smile and lazily pointed to something in front of us. A homeless man was dancing by the traffic lights across the street.
	
	He wasn’t that bad and he distracted us for a moment. Until I remembered I was sitting in an empty McDonald’s drive-through in the middle of the night with my best friend, both of us hungry.
	
	“Hello!” I screamed, startling Mick. I laughed. He didn’t.
	
	After I finally regained my composure, he pointed something out.
	
	“Wait. Do you see that?” Mick asked.
	
	“See what?”
	
	“You’re telling me you haven’t noticed it the whole time we’ve been sitting here?”
	
	I simply gave him a confused gesture. And then he pointed at the speaker.
	
	“No lights you idiot! They’re closed.”
	
	I looked at the speaker I had been verbally abusing throughout the night. Mick was right. It was completely off. The screen wasn’t showing anything. No words, no graphics, and no apple pie ads. Blank.
	
	I hung my arm outside the car window and stared at it. “Huh.”
	
	Mick shook his head. “Holy shit, Eric. Just pull up to the first window. Maybe someone’s there”
	
	As my foot began to push against the gas pedal, it quickly switched to the break, slamming it. Mick yelled out of absolutely nowhere.
	
	“Wait!” he said. “I have to pee first.”
	
	I gave him a blank stare. “Uhm, wait till we get home?”
	
	“Hell no, I have to go now. But I don’t want the employee at the window to see me. Just let me get out of the car and I’ll do it by the bushes real quick.”
	
	Mick hopped out of the car without closing the door and jogged a few feet away to relieve himself near some bushes. Considering the area, it probably wasn’t the first time someone did that there.
	
	As I waited for him, I lost myself staring into the empty streets before me, observing that one homeless man as he danced under the yellow lights of the street lamp posts.
	
	Mick was taking a while.
	
	Before I could honk my horn at him, he suddenly jogged back and we proceeded towards the window. It was closed.
	
	“You’ve gotta be kidding,” I said angrily. “So we waited here this whole time for nothing?”
	
	We finally drove out of there, but not before I noticed something strange as we left the drive-through. Something I haven’t told Mick about yet.
	
	My eye caught a movement near one of the bushes. I squinted and noticed someone kneeling behind it. I saw several of them actually. They were like shadowy figures. I couldn’t tell for sure though as it was much too dark at the time.
	
	The next morning I was walking down a street near the same McDonald’s we went to. I bumped into that same homeless man from the night before.
	
	I tried eagerly to avoid him as I made my way on the sidewalk, but he began to follow me, creeping closely behind.
	
	“They eat people!” he suddenly yelled over my shoulder. “They eat people! Do you hear me, boy? They even ate up my best pal! Swallowed him right up!”
	
	I stopped walking and turned to face him, pretending to listen to his psychotic rant.
	
	“You think I’m crazy don’t ya, boy? That McDonald’s you and your friend went to. It ain’t what you think.”
	
	I nearly dropped my one-dollar coffee on the sidewalk at those words. He noticed us? Sitting in the car? He enthusiastically continued,
	
	“Tell me, at anytime, did either of you get out the car?”
	
	I stared at him. Then he asked me again.
	
	“Well? Did you exit the vehicle or not?”
	
	I stuttered. “Y-Yeah. My friend had to pi-”
	
	“Fools! Both of ya!” he said at the top of his lungs.
	
	And then, he slowly began to let out a chuckle. “Your friend ain’t your friend no more, boy. Someone else came back in that car with you. Stay the hell away from him if you know what’s good for ya.”
	
	The homeless man began to slowly walk away, walking backwards while gazing at me. He seemed to be laughing at me, like he was in on a joke that I wasn’t. Something at my expense.
	
	The more I thought about it, the bigger the lump in my stomach became. There was an air of truth to the man’s words.
	
	He was definitely right about one thing.
	
	I went back to the drive-through Mick and I had visited that night. There was no McDonald’s. Wherever we went, wherever we were, it wasn’t there anymore. All I saw was an old, carless parking lot.
	
	And come to think of it, Mick has been acting very, very strange lately. Like when we finally left the drive-through that night, I caught him staring at me. He looked away when I caught him, pretending to search for other places to eat on his phone.
	
	He smiled when I asked him if he was still hungry, and I swear, I noticed a bit of drool around his lips.
==================================================
Late night in the morgue

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpkjs6/late_night_in_the_morgue/


	
	
	I'm sure you guessed already but I work in a hospital as a Doctor. No, I'm no forensic pathologist, but I was originally training to be one before I decided I preferred the living instead and assisting them. But after years of med school, I have found myself working in this small hospital sometimes assisting the incompetent forensic pathologist we have here.
	
	Sometimes they won't be sure of something so they ask me to double-check or I've spotted a huge mistake in the deceased's medical files and have had to check the bodies personally to find the real issues. This has been going on for years though and is honestly pretty casual in my hospital that I assist in the alternate field. I never enjoy it though, despite the preservation of the bodies with cooling, they still smell.
	
	It was late on Saturday night, well past my time to leave, my shift had ended 3 hours ago but Ralph messed up again. I've put in several complaints about his casual misconduct and sheer stupidity but somehow he remained to keep me up fixing his mistakes. The patient in question Quentin Ramirez was shot to death by police.
	
	He was a homeless crazy who stabbed a woman in the chest 6 times and was shot 8 times by police from what I recall. Ralph had his cause of death written as heart failure the idiot.
	
	I took a look at him, he had the stitching from the autopsy forming that capital 'Y' on his chest and seven bullet wounds across his torso, 5 in the guts and 7 in his chest, 2 in his left thigh, the last was just above his eyebrow. I understand why he had to be killed, I understand he was out of control and had already killed a civilian but 15 times seemed unnecessarily excessive. 1,2 or 3 should be the most you have to shoot someone.
	
	I overheard some staff speaking about Ramirez saying he was already down when two other officers arrived and let off a couple of rounds to be safe. It's like a madhouse in here. Ramirez was a thin, elderly Latino man, aged 66 and only 100 pounds. His body was nothing special. He was thin, you could almost make out his rib cage, his skin was sun-browned from years of not using sun cream and just letting himself burn under the sun. He had several scars along his forearms, hands and fingers.
	
	X-rays showed that the bones appeared to have been broken several times and all healed improperly. The joints looked above average thickness and size. Like the bones had reconstructed themselves far too many times. Similar activity appeared in his skull specifically the forehead. But on the outside, there were no visible signs of this. He didn't appear big-boned, his hands weren't large or swollen and neither was his forehead.
	
	I was sick of this. There was nothing to discuss. Quentin Ramirez had an odd bone structure and was shot to death. I called Ralph this time to maybe think about how much of an idiot he could be. I used the phone from his desk and began ringing, the first time nothing but the second time he quickly picked up.
	
	"Yeah what?" He groaned.
	
	"Hey, it's me, Thomas." I said,
	
	"Hey it's like midnight, you know I start early cause of traffic, what is it?"
	
	"Guess where I am?... I'm fixing your fuck up... you listed Quentin Ramirez's cause of death under heart failure. He was shot to death. He even has a bullet wound in his skull!"
	
	"Hey... just listen, man, it looks like a screw up I know but lemme talk."
	
	"What the hell is there to talk? 15 times he was shot!"
	
	"Yeah, he stabbed a girl in front of a cop, dragged her away and kept stabbing her. He called for back up and once the old bastard dropped the woman the cop shot him in the head..." Ralph said pausing for my response
	
	" Congratulations, a guy gets shot in the head and you still list it as heart failure," I said cynically
	
	"NO! He didn't go down. Why do you think other cops even arrived and shot him. 3 cops and 14 more bullets. He wouldn't go down. He even ran at them. Then he just stopped. He had a goddamn heart attack. But something was happening to his hands and forehead. Cops couldn't explain so we got the X-rays. I told em what I found and they said that couldn't explain it."
	
	"Oh man you know I don't believe any of that crap."
	
	"I'm serious, check out the police report and check out his heart. Talk to me again in the morning I'm done with this weird shit today." Ralph hung up.
	
	I was about done with his shit when I slammed the phone on his desk. I was reading through the police report and everything he had just told me was true. Ramirez was unstoppable.
	
	15 rounds all hits including a headshot. But there was something about his hands and forehead. Something was growing from his forehead and his hands were large, sharp and glowing. What the actual fuck I thought to myself. Was this some kind of messed up joke gone way too far I originally thought.
	
	But then I decided to take a second look at Ramirez's body specifically his arms and forehead. I moved his long matted grey hair away from his face and held a small light to his forehead. I found scars just under his hairlines two of them both recent they couldn't have been older than a year or so. They looked like exit wounds like something had forced its way out. I lifted his head to search for anything that could've penetrated the back of his skull. Nothing.
	
	The room felt colder, I even felt a shiver crawl its way up my spine. I decided that it was late and that I would look further into the possibility of heart failure then discuss it later with Ralph. I had to get some sleep.
	
	I closed Ramirez into his drawer. I packed up and cleaned the equipment I used and was about to leave when I was caught staring at the floor. It was covered in a black fog, it wasn't smoke, it wasn't rising to the ceiling, nothing smelt like it was burning if it was smoke I definitely would've smelt it by now. The room instead got only colder. I could see my breath thicker before it was barely noticeable now great white whisps were pouring out.
	
	I panicked as the black fog grew thicker and I could no longer make sense of the floor. It was so thick and then came the smell. The vile smell, it was gut-wrenching. I couldn't breathe through my mouth anymore it was disgusting. I tried rushing to the door but the fog slowed me, I was practically tripping over my own feet.
	
	I turned around to see the fog emanating all from Ramirez's draw. The corners of the small square door were spilling the fog out into the room. The smell became more familiar, it smelt like someone had been rotting.
	
	I froze in fear, it wasn't the cold that did this, if anything I preferred the cold in comparison to warm weather, so it didn't bother. The only thing that bothered me was the heavy breathing coming from Ramirez's drawer. It didn't sound natural, like a human's breathing at all. It was almost like a low growl.
	
	Then came the screaming, it was so deafening. One would think the drawer would muffle the sound in some way but then again everything that's happening right now shouldn't be happening. I wanted to run for the door again, to get out of whatever the fuck this was but the black fog erupted in front of the door covering it completely. It didn't fill the room, it only hid the door.
	
	I tried forcing my hands through it and feeling for the handle, but I couldn't feel anything, the door should've been there but there was nothing. I reached out to my elbows and still nothing. The door should've been right there, my hand should've been going through it, it was that close. But nothing.
	
	The screaming had stopped. Instead, there was a loud bang and a dent in the door holding Ramirez back. Again and again, more dents grew in the door until it finally flew off into the black fog covered floor. A burst of fog came out before it slowly filtered out like before. I nearly cried out like a madman when I saw the glowing red eyes hiding in the chamber.
	
	They were staring me down looking right through me. It hurt. It hurt to have that thing look at me. I just wanted it to go away, to shut its eyes and stay dead like it was supposed to. But then it's claw-like hands latched onto the sides of the opening. Twisted, jagged claws scraping the sides. It leapt out and stood tall. I was a blubbering mess, it wasn't tears or screaming, I was losing my damn mind.
	
	Ramirez's stitching had been pulled apart and his chest opened. Inside was an orange glow and a black ribcage. I looked up to his face and only saw horns. They were about 6 inches long, curving back past his fringe. The tips were glowing yellow like molten steel.
	
	He stared me down and retrieved a strange stone. It was a circle, like a sigil covered in strange markings all glowing red. Ramirez then found a scalpel and jabbed it into his shoulder, drawing out blood which he then wiped across the circular shaped stone whilst muttering something.
	
	He returned attention to me. He threw the table in front of him away effortlessly while still staring into my eyes still.
	
	"I'm sorry... but I have to kill it." He said to me as his horns and body began glowing more violently. He kneeled down to me. I still couldn't breathe from the fog, I could see that he was breathing but could feel no breath. His teeth appeared sharpened and larger but none of that mattered.
	
	His hand buried itself into my chest, ripping into me. I somehow still remained conscious. My eyes fixated on the horrid sight, I realised he wasn't mindlessly tearing away at me, he was making an incision. The pain broke me. I was screaming so loud for help, for anyone who might hear me. Someone must've been on this level showing up for a shift or maybe a janitor just cleaning. Anybody. Ramirez had finished opening up my chest. He then plunged his hand into the wound and pulled out my heart.
	
	I began tasting iron in my mouth from all of the blood filling it. My clothes were stained red, the only reason I couldn't see the new red splattered floor was because of the fog but I felt it. For some reason, the pain stopped but I could still see everything. I thought I was dead. I think it might've been too much for my brain process.
	
	Suddenly a knocking could be heard from the door beyond the cool room. "Anybody in there? Hey is everything okay? Heard screamin!" A guard called out.
	
	Ramirez slashed at the door behind me opening it and dragging me into the light-filled hallway directly in front of a security guard. "Holy fuck!" He yelled drawing his gun. I was only able to mumble the words "Don't let him kill me." Before Ramirez dragged me into the Janitors closet and covered the door with fog.
	
	"IN HERE! SOMETHING TOOK HIM INTO THE JANITOR CLOSET!" I heard the guard screaming for his pal.
	
	Ramirez got busy he took the sigil and placed it into my chest. I began to feel pain again. Something felt odd. Like my insides were crawling towards the sigil stone. Soon enough my wound closed itself but there was still burning in my chest.
	
	Ramirez stood up proud almost with a crazed smile across his face, his wounds were all gone. The gaping hole in his chest was all but gone, replaced with actual flesh. His horns had faded away like the black fog covering the door. The guard was still banging loudly against the door.
	
	"I did not want to hurt anyone else today but there is no other way to kill it." He said calmly as the guard burst in with his gun out, Ramirez jabbed him with the scalpel in the eye, retrieved the revolver from the guard and let him squirm in pain as he held his hands close to his eye but not daring to touch the scalpel. Ramirez drew the gun on me. The other guard, however, shot Ramirez before he could pull the trigger on me.
	
	"Suspect down, I need medical help here please!" He called out over his radio. I was still in shock, I couldn't move or think, it was all blank space to me for what seemed like hours or days. The next clear memory I have is whispering. I was in a hospital bed, staring at the wall, listening to something whisper in my head. "It's you and me now if you died I would find another, but he made us one. If you die, I die. I'm hungry... if we're going to survive I need something from you. All I can do is give you the strength to do it. Find them, find the wicked we need to cull them from the shepherd's herd."
	
	I haven't been a doctor for years, but hunting is a lucrative business, it keeps me well-fed, strong, and the herd is a little safer from the wolves.
==================================================
I decided to write this short story because I was bored

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpkg1b/i_decided_to_write_this_short_story_because_i_was/


	My Personal Turture Room
	A horror story, very graphic, do not read if you’re faint of heart...
	
	There is a woman tied to the chair, her arms tightly sealed on the arm rests while her legs are packed onto the chair legs. There is a also a table with different instruments on it. The woman seems to be conscious and well. A man walks up to her and whispers “are you ready for some fun?”. The man then proceeds to grab a knife. Slowly and surely the knife cuts into the ear, her screams muffled by the gag that is in her mouth, it cuts deep into the ear while blood is dripping down her neck and onto the floor. The ear hangs on to a bit of meat from her head, the man pulls it off suddenly. “Now for the second one!” he chuckles happily. This time he puts the knife down and picks up wire cutters. “Can we say wire-cutt-ers? No? Then let me show you what they do”. The man snips into the ear and it doesn’t cut through. He pushes the wire cutters harder and the ear drops to the floor. He drops the cutter and picks up the hatchet, “Can we count to ten?” he starts hacking the first finger off and then another and another.... “1...2...3...4...5... we’re half way there" he picks up salt and pures it on her fingers. She tries to scream only to be muffled again by the gag. He grabs the hatchet again and hacks at the other hand. “6...7...8...9...10!” He shouts with excitement . “Now time for some colours!” he picks up bleach “can we say, green?” without hesitation he pours the bleach onto her other hand with no fingers. Once again she tries to scream and cry but she cannot.
	
	The man puts down the hatchet. “Can we now say T-E-E-T-H?” he picks up a pliers and removes the gag. He grabs the first front tooth, twists it around and pulls it out. Her mouth is full of blood, she starts to scream.  He does the same with the second tooth and the third one. Until all the teeth have been pulled out. Jokingly he says “Can we say ouch? Oh no you can’t can you?” He puts down the pliers. Picks up a crowbar, and puts one end in her mouth. The man starts pushing up until he hears a click. The jaws opens wide and breaks. Her jaw now hangs. The man pull out the crowbar. Picks up scissors and pulls her tongue out. The man starts cutting through. When he is done the woman’s tongue drops and lies on the floor. The woman may be dead as she no longer screams. Yet the man doesn’t care. He picks up the spoon and shoves it into the eye socket of the woman and pulls out her eyeball, it flies out in incredible speed. And so does the second one. It is done, she is done... (NOTE SOME ACTIONS WERE TAKEN OUT AS THEY WERE A BIT TOO MUCH).
==================================================
A Week-Long Cruise to the Philippines

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpke57/a_weeklong_cruise_to_the_philippines/


	
	
	“Come on Dad!” She excitedly yelled.
	
	“Oh come on Emily. It’s not that big of a deal. It’s only a cruise.” I heaved with a sigh. I was really not feeling the mood at all. The Washington cold making me feel sluggish.
	
	“Come on honey. It’s not our fault you ‘work too hard’” My wife, Shelby, gaily exclaimed throwing air quotes up for comedic effect.
	
	I never liked going on trips. I have always preferred to work. Sometimes I would even miss family events if it was for the sake of finishing a presentation. My wife though, she was the complete opposite. She loved adventure and traveling. Out of everything she could’ve picked for my ‘mandatory’ vacation she chose the means of transportation in which I hate the most. When it came from the rocking of the boat to the thought of it collapsing. It doesn’t matter where we’re going, I hated cruises.
	
	However, we did it for my daughter since she’s never been on a cruise. Yet again, I hated cruises.
	
	I hoisted the last suitcase into the car when I was greeted by my neighbor Jim, who worked at my company, and his wife, Jessica.
	
	“Going on a trip I see?” He humbly questioned.
	
	“Yeah Jim, a cruise too.” My wife said while looking at me.
	
	“Oh, I thought you hated cruises? I guess you have to get over some fears.” Jessica inquired.
	
	“Yeah I guess. Say, what were you guys going to do this week?” I asked trying to change the topic.
	
	“Oh! We’re going to Canada to see the northern lights, I heard they’re beautiful this time of year!” Jim exclaimed. He always gets so riled up when it comes to things in the atmosphere. Guess that’s why he’s a meteorologist.
	
	“We need to get going or else we’re going to miss it!” Emily desperately yelled.
	
	“All well it was nice talking to you folks. I guess we’ll see you around later!” Jim gestured as we entered out car and drove off.
	
	It took about 3 hours to get to the bay where the enormous ship was docked. Since my higher-ups were funding this entire trip because of my spotless record I, or specifically my wife, got to choose what ship to go on and where. Since that was the case, Shelby chose the Shakespeare of the Seas, which was the biggest cruise ship ever made at the time and was making the first transatlantic voyage by Royal Caribbean. For that reason we were going to the Philippines. She said that it was the most convenient, although I highly doubt that, she’s talked about going there ever since we met in college. We’ve only gone outside of the country 3 times, 2 of which were before my daughter was born and the other one where she was too young to remember. So I couldn’t just refuse. Our little girl was an ambitious one and wanted to make her first cruise a memorable one.
	
	We arrived at security 1 hour before setting off. When we got through we immediately boarded and went to our 2-bedroom suite. It was spacious I’ll give them that. With an extra bed for Emily to sleep on. She was virtually bouncing around when we got inside. As soon as I locked the door behind me she bolted for the guest bedroom, suitcase in hand.
	
	It wasn’t long after until boarding ended and the muster drill started. It was normal at first, of course, save for the abnormal amount of security there and with most of them having a logo on their sleeve. The logo had a red circle with a white cursive S and E. Then however, the demonstrator said a series of directions, ‘Now if you see anything out of the ordinary on the surface of the water within the next 72 hours notify security immediately’. This perplexed me and my wife. After the drill ended I asked a security guard what all that meant. Apparently, a boat was stolen and they were notifying the patrons of the ship in case it was a plot for a terrorist attack, but then he reassured me that the cruise ship was unsinkable in a case like that. ‘This ship is unsinkable!’ he said enthusiastically. ‘Also if a situation like that were to happen we could just evacuate and a rescue team would be dispatched’ he explained. I wonder where that series of phrases was heard before.
	
	We decided to head to the pool a couple hours later and then go to dinner. The pool was extremely big, at least bigger than what we’re used to. While watching Emily make new friends near the water slides Shelby and I were at the bar. We met an interesting family. There was Jacob, who was a marine biologist, and his wife Victoria, who used to be a professional volleyball player. Then Emily came back with a friend, who just so happened to be their son. Turns out that they were from the same town we live in. We talked for the rest of the time at the bar and went to dinner at the windjammer together.
	
	From the first day we learned that they met in high school, went through a 6 month break, in which none of them cheated on each other, and had their son, whose name was Justin, 5 years after they married. They had a pretty healthy relationship from what we heard, and friendly to boot. Their son was also an absolute peach, it was no wonder why Emily made friends with him so quickly. We talked about letting them have play dates together when we get back to Washington. Me and Shelby talked about why we were taking the trip, and as I thought they found it amusing.
	
	“Really? From working too hard?” Jacob said while almost choking on his pizza slice.
	
	“Yeah, I thought it was pretty funny too.” Shelby wheezed out.
	
	The energy of the conversations after that were similar. Jacob and Victoria described hi-jinks they’ve experienced during their love life and Shelby and I spoke about more of ours. All the while Emily and Justin were in their own shared little world.
	
	After dinner we departed ways with them. Emily and Justin wished each other farewell and went their separate ways. We had a whole week until we arrived at the Philippines so we had a decent amount of time to look around the whole ship, and that was not counting the time during the return trip.
	
	It didn’t take too long for Emily to fall asleep. Before she passed out she asked if we would spend time with Justin’s family when we get to the Philippines.
	
	“Yes” I said with a smile.
	
	I then kissed her on the forehead, tucked her in, wished her goodnight, and left the room. Me and Shelby discussed what we were going to do when we get to the Philippines. We talked about possibly doing some activities with Justin’s family. She and I decided that it would be best to let them know and decide themselves instead of letting Emily and Justin get their hopes up. While we found their newly found friendship adorable, we had to keep the courtesy of letting them decide with their own terms in mind.
	
	The next day came in sooner than I thought. It felt like just a few seconds between me laying down and hugging my wife to me waking up from her kicking me. I looked over to her and blushed. She was just so cute when she was sleeping. I sighed and looked at my phone. I got a voicemail from Jim.
	
	“Hey man! We’re just about to go on the flight to Yukon in a bit. Just wanted to see how you were doing and that we’ll see you in a couple of weeks.”
	
	I smiled, Jim and his wife never seem to disappoint me with their enthusiasm.
	
	I got dressed and woke up my wife. She was not as happy as I was but still excited to do things on the ship. We went into Emily’s room only to see her already up, dressed, and ready.
	
	“Why am I always waiting for you?” She boasted merrily.
	
	“She is just like her mother.” I said to Shelby.
	
	She laughed and slapped me on the back. That woman really loves humor.
	
	The day went on as usual. We met up with Jacob, Victoria, and Justin. When Emily and Justin were playing in the pool again we discussed the plans with them. They thought it was a good idea to spend some time together on the islands. I was glad because at least Emily will have a friend to experience her first trip with. Besides that not much more happened though. Emily played with Justin some more. Dinner was much the same with Jacob, Victoria, Shelby and I sharing more stories with Emily and Justin talking.
	
	The next day though something odd happened. When I woke up I found a few texts from Jim.
	
	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
	
	2:02 A.M.
	
	*Hey man. There seems to be somebody stalking around our cabin. Just telling you in case we end up in some legal trouble while in the Ol' Maple State.*
	
	3:54 A.M
	
	*Called the cops. Whatever seemed to be outside went away, but we’re not taking any chances.*
	
	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
	
	I was thankful that they were at least being careful. I’ll tell you Jim and Jessica were some of the most polite people you would ever see. It just makes me worried to hear that somebody is taking an interest in their temporary place of residence. In the middle of the woods no less. I shrugged it off though. In any case, Jim was more than enough to handle some delinquents.
	
	The day after that was the same. I called Jim to make sure everything was okay. Apparently that one night was a one time thing and they’ve haven’t heard or seen anyone, or anything for that matter, since that encounter. I was relieved to say the least. We spent the day with Justin’s family some more. Saw a couple of movies, ate 4 cups of ice cream, and ate dinner at the windjammer again.
	
	However, the fifth day is when it all came crashing down. At about 4 in the morning, waves as tall as the boat itself came crashing down on the starboard. Emily was crying and weeping. It only lasted about a couple of minutes though. It perplexed the whole ship. In the evening I turned on the news and I was shocked to hear the news. Earthquakes that measured around 6.8 on the Richter scale rang all across the globe. Coastlines were wrecked and it would cost each victimized country trillions of dollars in repairs and compensation to its citizens. This explained the tsunami level waves the previous night. Luckily the ship wasn’t incapacitated. But instead it was thrown off course. We were supposed to travel the coast of Indonesia and make our way towards the Philippines, instead we were knocked more north.
	
	Just then, an announcement was made.
	
	***“Attention patrons of the Shakespeare of the Seas. By our estimate we will reach the coast of China in 2 days. Make sure you and your family are accounted for. If anyone becomes impaired or ill, immediately report to the infirmary for appropriate examination by our courageous medical staff!”***
	
	We were alleviated by the disclosure of asylum. The last thing we needed was to be stranded in the middle of the ocean. There was no telling how traumatized Emily will be after this incident. Later as the day went on, while me and Jim were looking at the view of the ocean, we saw a helicopter. It was white and red with a logo on the side. The logo was a red circle with a white cursive S and E. Since the sunset was present it was clear that it was headed east.
	
	“Weird” Jim said clearly troubled.
	
	“Maybe it’s a search and rescue chopper. There’s no doubt many small fishing boats got lost in the chaos that we experienced last night.” I spoke, trying to reassure him.
	
	“I know, but why is it all the way out here. Going east no less. There’s no islands for miles upon miles on end.”
	
	“Yeah, you’re right.”
	
	We watched the view for about another hour before the sun set. After that we decided to clock in for the night. I thought what will happen once we reach China. Will we be taken in? Or will we be treated like wasteful refugees? The fear slowly rose through me. It was as if my brain did a total one-eighty. I decided to sleep the feeling away with Shelby and Emily. They were both understandably unsettled by the whole situation. Shelby more than Emily as much as she would like to admit otherwise.
	
	About 5 or 6 hours later I woke up in a panic. There was yelling reverberating somewhere on the ship. Inhuman yelling and shrieking can be heard throughout the walls. I woke up Shelby without waking Emily and told her to get dressed. She clearly knew what was going on since she also heard the howling. When we got out the door we saw Jacob and Victoria sprinting towards us with Justin in Jacobs arms. Jacob told us to come with them to the 7th deck as the lifeboats were being sorted as an emergency evacuation was ordered.
	
	I didn’t argue because as soon as I looked out one of the windows I could see at least one-eighth of the ship being consumed in what I presume is a jelly-like substance. It was glowing a greenish-blue hue in the moonlight. We went to the 7th deck the quickest we could. When we got to where the lifeboats were being distributed we found that not many people were present. Only a few people from our part of the ship. Or, more specifically, the part that wasn’t being consumed. We didn’t ask questions though. As there wasn’t that great of a number of people present they let us on without any hesitation. It was obvious that the security were as terrified as we were.
	
	Then I heard a shriek coming from the stern of the ship. What stood there was a series of people running from a mob of humanoid gelatinous organisms. Shuffling as they were trying to lunge at the fleeing crowd. About 15 more people got on the lifeboat before it was dropped by a security guard. As we were being lowered and eventually dropped, the guard, that essentially saved our lives, was overwhelmed and tackled by one of the figures. Soon his entire body was consumed by the green substance with him joining the mob of creatures in pursuing the crowd rushing towards that last few lifeboats that remained.
	
	Jacob glanced at me then at Justin. It was only then that I noticed his ankle glowing with a greenish-blue hue. We knew what was going to happen, but we waited, and waited, and waited. It was at the point where his entire leg was absorbed with it. Emily was long asleep by now with all the stress no doubt making her pass out. Justin was also knocked out, but not in the pleasing way. His body looked like it was being absorbed by the material. But we waited.
	
	We were eventually saved by a Chinese rescue team. Looked like the security guard was right. We drifted for god knows how long. So it’s safe to say that we were all pretty glad to be rescued. We were hoisted onto the vessel by our saviors. When it eventually became Justin’s turn, the man that put us all on the boat shook his head.
	
	“Not him.” He said, with no feeling in his voice.
	
	“No...please, he’s all we got!” Victoria pleaded with the man.
	
	The man wouldn’t concede though and it came to the point where Victoria had to put him down in the lifeboat. However, as the engines were revved up and as we were about to go, the man emptied a container of gasoline onto the lifeboat where Justin was lifelessly laying on, and lit it ablaze. Victoria cried but Jacob didn’t. Some part of me likes to think that he accepted what happened. We sailed away from the burning craft towards the shore. Where it has seen better days.
	
	As we were relocated to a refugee camp, we were questioned on what we saw. Jacob, Victoria, Shelby and even Emily were questioned on the events that took place. When it was finally my turn I walked in and took a seat at the dull metal table that was placed in the interrogation room. It looked more like a prison if anything. The first thing I noticed was the interrogators badge on his sleeve. It had a red circle with a white cursive S and E on it. As he was questioning me I remembered why my employers sent me on this trip. ‘Working too hard’ they said. Look where it’s gotten me now.
	
	“Well you’ve been really cooperative Mr. Cooper. Unfortunately, we'll have to do something about this incident I don’t think you’ll find...appealing.” He spoke, his dead monotone voice echoing off the walls.
	
	“Who are you?” I asked confused.
	
	"That's not something I have to disclose." He confidently mustered.
	
	As he was getting up, my wife, daughter, Jacob, and Victoria were brought into the room by a group of burly security guards that were armed to the teeth. As I was trying to process what was happening Jacob fell to the ground. Victoria screamed before she was shot as well. Shelby looked at me before half of her head was blown off. I pleaded with the man to let Emily go, but all he said was:
	
	"We don't have bias for anyone".
	
	As he said that my precious daughter was disposed of. Without any mercy or hesitation. I turned and looked the man in the eye just as my arms were taken by those same guards.
	
	"Soran Enterprises doesn't worry about collateral."
	
	And just as he said that, the barrel of a pistol was held against the back of my head.

In the water

	I present to you........
	
	In the Water
	
	This event happened many years ago. The family had made the journey by car up to the Central coast. Apparently we have been there before when I was really little. But... I don't really remember it. We were going to stay with my aunt and uncle at a holiday resort.  I slept most of the way, like I usually did with long car trips and it would often mean I would have a burst of energy when we arrived.
	
	I don't remember my dream if I had one. Dad placed his hand on my shoulder and gently shook me to wake me up. I rubbed my eyes and looked around. It didn't take long for me to fully wake up. The resort was pretty big. I could see a BBQ area, a playground, several cabins, and it was really close to the water. The dock was close by and it could be seen by the cabin we would be staying in.
	
	I got out of the car and looked around with my sister. We got fish and chips for dinner and settled in. It had several different bedrooms so it meant my parents shared one, my aunt and uncle had theirs, and my sister and I had the two single beds in a room close to the front of the cabin.
	
	The floor was wood. It was old and didn't have carpet. Everyone else was tired and off to sleep. I could hear the faint snoring from the other rooms. I looked over towards my sister. She was sound asleep. I was feeling restless because I slept earlier. Naturally my parents told me to stay in bed so I wouldn't wake anyone.
	
	Perhaps I should just get a glass of water?
	
	Slowly I looked around the room. It was quiet. Dark but not perfectly black. I decided against it because the floor was creaky, and I didn't want to wake up my parents. My Dad could be quite a grump when he was woken up. I pulled the blanket up over my head, snuggled into it and rolled over to face the wall. I blinked a couple of times. Right when I was about to drift off to sleep...
	
	I could hear the floor make noise on the other side of the room behind me..... I froze. I drew in my breath and was as quiet as possible.
	
	Anything in order to hear the steps.
	
	I hadn't heard the door open, and the last I saw. My sister was still asleep in bed. Or at least... she should have been. I began to relax, blinked a few times and the walking started again.
	
	Slowly the footsteps walked towards me and suddenly stopped at the foot of my bed.
	
	Then nothing.
	
	I gulped.
	
	Silently waited with the blankets tightly wrapped around me. I waited for, who I thought was my sister... it was the only person it could have been to poke me or just something...
	
	Nothing.
	
	Then I felt a weight on my feet. Someone was sitting on me.
	
	My eyes widened in fear and my body was tense. I waited for my sister to say something or to joke around. Eventually I must have fallen asleep.......
	
	I woke up the next morning later than everyone else. It felt as though I hadn't slept properly for months. I rubbed my eyes and could smell breakfast cooking. Pancakes, toast, bacon and eggs. My stomach grumbled instantly.
	
	I pushed the blankets off and placed my feet on the floor. I stood up and saw my blankets had a wet, dirty patch where my feet had been.
	
	What?
	
	There were two footprints on the floor.
	
	They were both dirty and still wet.
	
	I stared down at them in fear, anger and confusion. I .... didn't think it would have been my sister. Who else could it have been? I didn't want to get in trouble for getting them dirty.
	
	I turned and said to my sister, "Why did you try to scare me last night? And why were you wet and dirty?"
	
	"What? No. Why would I do a thing like that?"
	
	"Well who else could it have been? A gnome?"
	
	Dad came in, and as expected. He wasn't happy. I tried telling him that it wasn't me. I had to clean up the mess, and I was not pleased about this at all. But... what else could I say? I cleaned up the mess, and joined my family for breakfast before we walked to the water.
	
	The water was peaceful. The sound of the water was endless and relaxing to listen to. It had that distinctive water smell.  We were going to go fishing for the first time. My uncle had bought my sister and I fishing rods. We caught plenty of fish.. and hilariously my uncle didn't catch any... and he actually sulked about it.
	
	It was pretty funny.
	
	Later on that evening I walked along the dock and looked down into the water. I thought I saw a long... white eel but then I noticed ..... there was a hand attached to it....
	
	W...what?
	
	It started waving up at me. Curling it's fingers to encourage me to get closer.....
	
	I couldn't look away from it. Whatever it was. I was spellbound. The pale hand reached into the water. I leaned closer. Nothing else mattered or existed anymore.
	
	What looked like a head looked like it was about to rise to the surface.......
	
	When........
	
	My dad grabbed me and did that thing where they would hold onto you, but pretend they were going to push you in. I squealed and burst into giggles. The spell was broken. I could move and look away. We walked back towards the cabins to eat dinner and get ready for bed.
	
	I couldn't help but look back at the water.
	
	But .... I saw nothing.
	
	I was nervous about going to go to sleep. I got ready for bed. It was a lot warmer than it had been previously so I wore a singlet nightie and, only had my blanket around my legs. Curled up and watched as my sister read her book with the light on. Eventually, she turned it off and said goodnight. I was tempted to ask her to stay up late with me.
	
	Slowly the noise of the cabin slowed down.... and the sound of light snoring could be heard.
	
	Then...
	
	Nothing.
	
	Not a sound.
	
	All I could do was relax and hope that I would fall asleep soon. I rolled over to face the wall. Sighed, wiggled my toes and began to drift off to sleep.
	
	I was so, so close.
	
	I heard the footsteps again. Slowly they got louder as whoever or whatever it was came up behind me. It didn't stand at the foot of the bed. It stood by the side. With me being stuck between it and the wall.
	
	It said nothing.
	
	I said nothing.
	
	I shivered in place.
	
	Slowly I could feel it sit on the bed behind me. I tried not to say anything or move. I couldn't speak. My eyes were wide in horror as I felt it curl in around me.
	
	It was wet.
	
	A child, about my height and weight.
	
	And the bite of the cold was sharp.
	
	It hurt so much. It was so cold it burned.
	
	It lay close to me. I closed my eyes, pretended to be asleep and silently prayed. I prayed to God, to anything or anyone who would save me from... whatever this was.
	
	I heard a gargling behind me.
	
	It... it sounded like it was trying to speak to me.
	
	I closed my eyes shut. I said nothing. I must have drifted off to sleep.
	
	I awoke with my bed still wet. It smelled.... like the river... I wrinkled my nose in disgust. My sister asked me what was on the back of my head. I reached back and pulled....
	
	Seaweed?!
	
	There was seaweed and grimy dirt.
	
	I didn't know what to say. Before my parents woke up I put the bed linen in the laundry, re-made my bed ... and admittedly, not well... and got in the shower when I heard that they were waking up.
	
	This wasn't turning into much of a holiday.
	
	I wanted to go home.
	
	Anywhere but here.
	
	Today I went out onto the boat with my sister, uncle and Dad to try to catch fish. We were pretty successful. I can't remember what kinds were caught. I kept double checking over the side. Paranoid that I would see a pale arm or the boat would tip over.
	
	But.. it didn't happen.
	
	We got back to shore safely. The fish were being prepared. There was another family staying there that my family were getting close with. They shared their oysters. I didn't want to try them. They looked like blobs of snot but I was called a chicken, so I had to try it.
	
	It was.... eh... interesting.
	
	My sister was playing by the dock. The water on one part was shallow enough to easily see things. You could see baby fish, occasionally a jellyfish or a crab but what she was most excited about was an eel in the deeper end. I went over to look but I missed it. I didn't want to admit that I missed it.
	
	I said it was pretty cool.
	
	I went to go chat with my aunty when I heard a loud splash.
	
	I don't know how it happened but she fell in. And... honestly? It was pretty hilarious. I nearly wet myself with laughter. My uncle was there to help her out of the water. She was asked why she fell in. Her face was bright red with embarrassment, and she didn't say why. Even when I pressed her about it.
	
	It was the last night we would be spending there. Everything was packed away so we could leave early. I felt better about things. The routine was pretty standard. I got ready for bed and made sure I was asleep first. I didn't want to be the last one asleep.
	
	I drifted off to sleep easily and happily having a much needed rest after a long day. Soon I was asleep.
	
	I couldn't move.
	
	I woke up pinned between the wall and ..... that cold, lifeless and wet body had returned. The .. child? Was back again. It tightly held onto my body while I struggled to breathe. My arms were tightly pinned. I struggled... it was a lot stronger than I was......
	
	No.... no.....
	
	I tried to speak but I couldn't.
	
	But... it could.......
	
	The freezing cold was on my neck.
	
	"Your sister was supposed to be payment for all the fish. I will see you again," It kissed my cheek.
	
	"we can swim together. Forever........"
	
	I haven't been back there again.
	
	I never want to go back.
	
	Ever.
	
	And I hope my sister never goes back either.

	*How the hell did we get here?*
	
	At that moment, it was all that I could think about.
	
	“As fun as this has all been, and it certainly has… jeez,” Adrian laughed to himself. “I almost forgot what I came here for. This coke is deadly sometimes-“
	
	“There’s no way in goddamned hell. Don’t even fucking say it.” Sandhu cut him off.
	
	Adrian raised a brow. “Yeah? Is that so? Look, I get this whole guardian protector role you’re trying to play here. Commendable, really. And I’m sure the kid’s been through a lot but…”
	
	His lips curled into a malicious grin.
	
	“I’ve been through a lot as well. And you know what I’ve learned? This kid’s gonna fucking croak if he keeps hanging out with you. He’s strong, sure. But he can get a lot stronger. You guys got *lucky* against Kentay. It won’t happen every time. You don’t want that, do you?”
	
	“You literally want to send him off to death-fights on some godforsaken planet. What the fuck are *you* talking about?” I interjected.
	
	Adrian groaned. “Oh, why don’t you shut the fuck up? Just SHUT THE FUCK UP!!”
	
	As much as I hated to admit it, the sound of him raising his voice caused me to go quiet.
	
	There was a powerful aura surrounding him. Like a switch in his demeanor that would flip instantly and aggressively. In all honesty, my will simply wasn’t strong enough to challenge him any further. Out of everybody there… I was certainly the weakest.
	
	“Look,” Ken said, stepping forward. “I have no idea where the hell you crawled out from, but we kinda went through a lot just now trying to protect the kid. We’re not gonna let him go just like that.”
	
	“Tch,” Adrian clicked his tongue. “I don’t like getting my hands dirty but…”
	
	He moved in a flash, rushing towards Sandhu with startling velocity.
	
	However, his strike was intercepted by Kael at the last moment.
	
	“Shit…” Kael muttered, holding Adrian’s fist back. “How is *this* guy strong as well?”
	
	Adrian struggled for a moment, before breaking Kael’s wrist and slamming a palm into his jaw. He went back at Sandhu, only to be stopped again by a stream of blades from Bella, shredding his right arm as he blocked it.
	
	“FUCK!” he shouted. “Why the hell are you people so hung up over this kid anyway?”
	
	“Are you an idiot? What kinda question is that?” Ken said, stepping forward. With his caked in dry blood, he looked as if he were about to pass out at any moment. Still, he offered the challenge.
	
	“I couldn’t live with myself if I let a freak like you near him,” he said, before opening up another portal. “This guy’s one of my favorites. Glad he’s still around for you.”
	
	A *massive* skeleton with bits of charred flesh dangling off of its oversized bones emerged from the portal. It revved up an equally oversized chainsaw, before charging at Adrian.
	
	“What the fu-“
	
	He barely got the words out before he was forced to evade certain decapitation. He bobbed and weaved away from the devastating blades, before eventually taking a few nasty cuts.
	
	At the same time, Kael was back on his feet, giving Adrian further trouble on top of it all. Bella soon joined in, forcing his back against the wall.
	
	“FUCK!” He spat, before *leaping* into the air and obliterating a good portion of the skeleton’s skull with an elbow strike. Not enough. The skeleton grabbed him by the neck and thrashed him onto the floor. As he struggled to pull himself up, Kael swooped in knocked him back down.
	
	“About time to give up, don’t you think?” He grinned.
	
	Adrian spat out a good amount of blood. “You really don’t want that.”
	
	He bolted up, drilling his head into Kael’s chin, before launching himself head-first at the skeleton’s torso.
	
	“I figured it out!” he screamed. “I just need to get rid of your fucking arms!”
	
	He did just that, snapping both of the skeleton’s elbows at the joints, causing it to drop the chainsaw. He was about to go in for the killing blow when a stream of Bella’s shards hit one of his eyes, blinding him in it. .
	
	“FUCKING BITCH!” he shouted.
	
	The skeleton capitalized on the momentary distraction, kicking him into a wall.
	
	Safe to say, things were *not* going Adrian’s way.
	
	He looked up as Kael, Bella and the skeleton began converging on him all at once, his expression still rife with frenetic, concentrated rage. However… it didn’t linger. Soon enough, he began *smiling*.
	
	“Ok, alright,” he said, holding up a hand. “Can’t say that this was a fair fight, but you got me. Damn, I thought I was tougher than this.”
	
	He stood up, the grin still plastered across his face.
	
	“Guess it’s time for plan B.”
	
	“What the hell does that mean?” Ken asked.
	
	“Well… I gave you a hint. You are *not* going to like this.”
	
	From his pocket, he pulled out some kind of clunky switch wrapped in a mess of wires.
	
	“I’m releasing the big boy. *The Calamity*.”
	
	The hairs on the back of my neck stood up.
	
	Kael began stepping forward, but Adrian held his hand out.
	
	“Are you dumb? You’re nowhere near fast enough to get to me in time.”
	
	He suddenly looked over to Bella, who was visibly itching to spray him with some more blades.
	
	“You too. Don’t even fucking try it.”
	
	“Don’t you know how stupid of an idea this is?” Ken said.
	
	“Ok prof, lecture me some more. I mean, you guys brought this onto yourselves. I had a simple request,” he let out another insane laugh, before abruptly going serious. “Last chance. I mean it.”
	
	Nobody moved. In fact, nobody said anything at all. We were all at a loss for what to do.
	
	“How could you have figured out how to release it?” Ken finally spoke up. “You’re bluffing.”
	
	“Yeah? Well, you’re pretty fucking annoying.”
	
	He flipped the switch before dropping it on the ground.
	
	“I’m a fucking genius,” he said. “I can do anything.”
	
	As Adrian continued to grin with malicious anticipation, the rest of us waited in tense silence for what felt like 5 minutes… but nothing happened.
	
	Ken broke the silence. “You know, when people bluff, they usually don’t go this far.”
	
	Adrian’s face contorted into a confused rage.
	
	*”Gimme a fucking break,”* he spat out. “All this work for nothing…”
	
	He took a glance over his shoulder.
	
	“Nah… this is bullshit. I’m not an idiot.”
	
	Like a bat out of hell, he took off down the opposing corridor.
	
	“He’s checking the panel.” Ken said.
	
	*That’s right*, I thought to myself. The panel was the only real way we could confirm whether or not he was really bluffing.
	
	Truth be told, none of us had any idea what the Calamity could’ve been. We all just assumed it was going to be some colossal monstrosity of a creature that was going to be bent on immediate destruction following its release.
	
	But… we didn’t *know*. Perhaps the danger it posed was more esoteric. Something non-direct.
	
	“We should go see for ourselves,” I spoke up. “At this point, whatever happens is going to happen.”
	
	It didn’t take too much convincing. Ken created another portal, pulling the skeleton back through it. With a fog of demise looming in the air around us, the 6 of us began making our way.  The fighting was finally. The only thing left to do was to confirm our fate.
	
	When we got to the panel, we were met with an unfavorable sight.
	
	The light was *yellow*. Escape in progress.
	
	Not only that… but a *trap door* had opened up in the floor to the side, with a set of stairs leading down it. Adrian was right there, leering down into it.
	
	“What’d I tell you?” he said. “I’m not an idiot.”
	
	“Well, what the hell are you gonna do now?” Ken asked. “Go down there and then *what*? Tame it or something?”
	
	“Tame it… die… we’ll see what happens. Not like it matters anymore. Unless you wanna give me the kid.”
	
	Sandhu didn’t budge.
	
	Adrian scoffed. “I’ll be honest… I was planning on releasing this thing regardless. You can’t just keep something like this all locked up, you know?” His remaining eye was wide with excitement as he said it.
	
	He looked back at the trap door.
	
	“The great unknown, huh?” He muttered, before bolting down the stairs.
	
	“Should we have stopped him?” Kael asked, as Adrian disappeared into whatever abyss was waiting for him.
	
	“I… I don’t know,” Ken responded. “Would there have been a point?”
	
	A long period of silence followed. It could’ve been an hour. Maybe close to 2. But regardless of the time… *nothing* happened. No giant creature bursting out from the floor. No portal sucking us into hell.
	
	Well, one thing did change. The light on the panel turned from yellow to red.
	
	*The Calamity had escaped.*
	
	But that happened a while ago.
	
	Adrian never even came up. Safe to say, we were at a loss for any kind of explanation.
	
	“So… what now?” Bella asked. “Do we leave or…?”
	
	“Feels weird leaving it like this, doesn’t it?” Kael responded.
	
	“I guess,” Ken added. “Don’t really know where else to go from here, though.”
	
	“There is one other option.” I said. It was an instinctive outburst. Something I was hardly thinking about myself.
	
	“And what is that?”
	
	I gestured towards the open door.
	
	“We could go down and see what happened for ourselves.”
	
	Ken blinked a few times in disbelief.
	
	“Are you fucked in the head?”
	
	*Was I?* It was a fleeting thought.
	
	“Aren’t you curious?” I asked. “About what they’ve been trying to contain this whole time?”
	
	Ken laughed. “Well, I never wanted to be here in the first place, so it really doesn’t matter to me. But if you wanna go, then make it quick. I’m sure this place won’t be quiet for much longer.”
	
	I stopped myself for a second.
	
	*Is this really what I want?* I thought to myself. I didn’t really know. Yet… there was some kind of strange impulse driving me forward.
	
	“Maybe there was never a calamity in the first place,” Kael spoke up. “What if it was just a scare tactic?”
	
	That theory could’ve held some weight, but it didn’t answer the question of what the hell had happened to Adrian.
	
	“Oh, it exists for sure.”
	
	A new voice came from behind us. We all turned around, already on edge from everything that had happened before.
	
	But it was *Clint*, still bloody and beaten from his bout with the Warden.
	
	“Clint?” Ken grinned at him. “Jeez, you’re still alive? Nassar and I made a bet about whether or not you were gonna survive. Can’t really collect now since he’s dead though…”
	
	“Yeah?” Clint smiled back. “How much you put on me?”
	
	“About 600.”
	
	“God, I’m offended. Don’t you have any faith in me, buddy? I know you’re a high-roller. At least in Vegas…”
	
	“You know, it’s great that you guys are friends and all,” Kael interrupted. “But what the hell were you saying about the Calamity?”
	
	“I’ll tell you, but first you gotta tell *me* something. Who the *hell* opened up the door?”
	
	“Uh… this crazy fucking guy. Don’t think you know him.” I responded.
	
	“And he’s down there. Right now?”
	
	I nodded. Clint’s expression turned dead serious.
	
	“Goddamn it.” He muttered.
	
	He drew a handgun from his belt and began rapidly descending the stairs.
	
	The rest of looked at each other in confusion before quickly following after him. It was a longer journey than I had anticipated. It really begged the question of why such a lengthy set of stairs was constructed in the first place.
	
	Once we got down there, we found ourselves in some kind of laboratory, with dusty monitors and haphazard stacks of documents strewn everywhere. At the very end of the lab was a metal door that was wide-open. We could see Adrian standing inside the room that it led into.
	
	I couldn’t really tell what he was doing at first. It kind of just looked like he was standing still. And then I realized… that’s all that he *was* doing. He paid no attention to us. He was simply staring ahead.
	
	Although… I couldn’t quite see what he was staring at.
	
	At first, that is.
	
	“Whatever you do, do *not* look inside the damn room!” Clint shouted at us.
	
	He said it just a little bit too late.
	
	I don’t know how I can describe what I was seeing. On the surface, it’s simple. There was a monitor. Adrian was simply staring at a monitor.
	
	But what was on that monitor was tougher to explain. An amalgamation of incomprehensible shapes and figures, shifting and moving in ways completely alien to human perception.
	
	And then… there were the *colors*. Colors I’d never seen before in my life. Colors that I’m pretty sure didn’t exist. In that moment, I could feel my mind fading. My sense of self dissolving into the void. I was utterly transfixed on whatever the hell was on that monitor. I could feel some kind of strange pleasure overwhelming my senses. But at the same time… I was trying my absolute *hardest* to look away. My emotions were utterly conflicted, which only worsened the already-perplexing situation.
	
	I was eventually snapped out of it after some unknown duration. I remember jumping at the sounds of multiple gunshots, before feeling a debilitating migraine and experiencing fleeting moments of blindness. I bent over in pain, before blinking a few times and looking back up to see Clint carrying Adrian’s limp, bullet-ridden body, with the door to the room now shut behind him.
	
	As soon as he was done with that, he pressed his back against the wall, eyes wide and breathing heavy like a child who’d just seen a ghost.
	
	“What the hell was that all about? And what the fuck is wrong with *you*?” Ken asked him.
	
	I guess nobody else had gotten a glimpse of the monitor, because they wouldn’t have been asking that.
	
	“That’s… that was the calamity, wasn’t it?” I said, still mentally reeling from the experience.
	
	Clint looked at me and nodded.
	
	“But… what…?”
	
	I could barely get the question out, but Clint answered regardless.
	
	“Some things don’t have simple answers. All that *I* know is that somewhere out there… in the vast expanse above us… there’s something that we were *never* meant to see. Something that we *cannot* cross paths with.”
	
	“But… if it’s up there… then we shouldn’t have to worry about it then, right? What’s with all this shit? And why the hell are we monitoring it?” I asked.
	
	Clint sighed. “Here’s the thing… as soon as we found out about its existence… it found out about ours. In a way, we’re linked to it. Every second that a human eye perceives that thing, it reciprocates that attention. If somebody looks at it for too long… then they’re pretty much inviting it right over to us.”
	
	I could hardly respond to this shit.
	
	“I guess I should tell you all this part as well,” he continued. “It’s *already* coming towards us. Best ETA’s put it at about around 19000 years away. But after today… it’s probably a lot closer now.”
	
	He looked down at Adrian. “This asshole just shortened humanity’s lifespan by a couple thousand years.”
	
	And then he looked up at me. “I saw you looking as well,” he said. “Lucky I snapped you out of it before you went insane. You probably just cost us about 50 years as well.”
	
	“Okay…” Kael spoke up. “Not that I’m following any of this… but how are we *stopping* this thing from arriving?”
	
	Clint let out a dry laugh. “That’s what they’ve been trying to figure out. Why they built this fucking lab in the first place. It’s funny though. All of their research probably just brought it closer.”
	
	“Huh,” Ken said. “So that’s the deal with the calamity. Wouldn’t have been my first guess.”
	
	“Yeah, pretty wacky shit.” Clint said as he got up. “Well, we better get the hell out of here. This place is about to be swarmed.”
	
	“Sure, but where the hell would we go? The moment we try getting off this island, we’re getting shot at. Maybe it’s better to just take our chances here and explain the situation.” Kael said.
	
	“No fucking way we’re staying here.”
	
	Sandhu, Ken and Bella responded in unison.
	
	“We better figure out something soon,” Bella said. “Getting out of here’s gonna be tough.”
	
	“It won’t be *tough*. It’s gonna be impossible.”
	
	“What?”
	
	“The island’s already surrounded, and the cavalry’s ready to pounce on any stragglers. They know about everybody who was supposed to be in here and they’re gonna hunt down the ones who don’t get accounted for.”
	
	He paused for a moment.
	
	“In other words, you guys would be fucked,” and then he grinned. “If I wasn’t here.”
	
	He took out a bizarre-looking cell-phone and dialed a number.
	
	“Hey, I’m done,” he spoke into it. “Come pick me up.”
	
	Before we could ask any questions, a small, blue portal opened up in the ground a few meters away from us.
	
	“So you can do it too, huh?” Ken said.
	
	“Yessir,” Clint responded. “But there’s no monsters coming outta this one.”
	
	Moments later, a well-built man with a heavy mass of a beard who looked to be in his late-20s popped out.”
	
	“What the hell, Clint? Where’s your own fucking transporter?”
	
	“Warden broke it.”
	
	The man laughed. “Oh, right. How was that, by the way?”
	
	“What’d you think, Pete? I Almost died.”
	
	“I’m surprised you made it out at all. That Warden’s a tough bastard. And you brought company, huh?”
	
	He looked over each one of us, before gesturing towards the portal.
	
	“Well don’t be scared. Jump in.”
	
	There were a few more objections, of course. Mostly from Kael and I. Kael was still clinging on to his identity as some reprehensible criminal who belonged in this place, while I was shitting myself at the prospect of jumping into some blue hole in the ground.
	
	However… everybody else was raring to go. I suppose they all had their reasons. The kid looked like as if he was about to pass out, but he really didn’t have a say in the matter. Sandhu was just trying to get him the hell away from this place.
	
	I only ended up jumping in when I heard the sounds of boots on metal from above us.
	
	I’m not quite sure how to describe my journey through the portal. Disorienting, I guess? But at that point, my senses had become pretty dulled anyway.
	
	We were transported to the top of a metal tower overlooking some desert-like expanse. The surface was crawling with ghastly creatures that looked to be some kind of coyote-scorpion hybrid. And they sure as hell were aggressive, constantly attacking, ripping apart and cannibalizing each other.
	
	At the edge of the platform we were on, there was a sniper-rifle mounted with a stool at the bottom. There were also empty boxes of snack cakes and beef jerky packets strewn across the floor.
	
	“Why are you hanging out in this dump?” Clint asked him, looking disgusted at the sight below.
	
	“Target practice,” Pete responded. “Remember the guy we were supposed to kill in Paradise X? Couldn’t hit him for shit, and then I nearly got my dick chopped off-“
	
	“Hold on, are you just *not* gonna explain where the fuck we are?” Kael interrupted, sounding somewhat exasperated.
	
	“I mean, I thought what just happened was pretty obvious,” Pete responded. We hopped to another dimension. Congrats, you’re a jumper now!”
	
	*A jumper*. Didn’t Adrian say something about that?
	
	“So, where do you wanna go next?” Clint asked.
	
	“Wait… what’d you mean?” Ken spoke up. “Like… to another dimension?”
	
	Clint nodded.
	
	“Well, I mean… I thought we were…”
	
	“Jeez Ken, I thought you were a little more adventurous than that.”
	
	Ken sighed. “I don’t know. I make my around Earth pretty well, you know?”
	
	“I’m down.” Bella said, causing Ken to whip his head around.
	
	“You’re serious?”
	
	“Yeah. I mean, what’s left to do on Earth? Might as well see something cool while we’re alive. Besides, if you go back, you’re just gonna get captured again. You really aren’t as slick as you think. And what was that thing you told me all those years ago?”
	
	Ken raised an eyebrow.
	
	*”I’ll follow you anywhere.”* Bella said mockingly.
	
	Ken chuckled somewhat nervously. “I never said that. Maybe it was similar, but it wasn’t that lame.”
	
	“Whatever,” Bella continued, walking towards Clint and Pete. “I know where I’m going. And it’s not back to Earth.”
	
	Ken hesitated for a few more moments before ultimately relenting.
	
	“Jeez,” he said. “This is fucked up.”
	
	“What about you, vampire?” Clint looked tat Kael.
	
	“I’m not sure,” he responded. “I think a vacation’s more than I deserve.”
	
	“Hmmm…” Clint continued. “So you still think that rotting away in a prison’s gonna do anybody any good? Well I’ll tell you something that might pique your interest.”
	
	“There’s a planet named *Gehenna* out in an area called ‘The Dark Zone.’ There’s no rules there. No interdimensional government has any jurisdiction over it, and any task force they send gets obliterated. And trust me… there’s some *bad* shit happening to innocent beings over there. Shit that makes your blood boil just by thinking about it. It can’t be helped, I guess. Nobody coming to take out the bad guys and stop the suffering…
	
	He looked Kael dead in the eye.
	
	“Look, you’re not the strongest, but you’re strong enough to make a difference. Not to mention, you can get even stronger. Don’t waste your life. Go and help those people. There’s a militia of vigilantes called “The Deliverance” pushing back against the gangs and traffickers controlling that place. We can get you over there. And then you can go and find them. Join them. Tell them I sent you.”
	
	It took a moment, but Kael ultimately relented to the proposition. Even though he was acting reluctant, I could tell that he was glad. He had a purpose once again.
	
	“Now…” Clint said, turning to face us. “What do we do with you guys?”
	
	Ajay still looked terrified as he clung onto Sandhu.
	
	“Jeez, Clint,” Pete said, as he fired another sniper bullet down into the mass of creatures. “You’re getting kids caught up in your messes as well?”
	
	Sandhu sighed. “Look, I appreciate you getting us out of there but… we need to go back.”
	
	Clint and I both raised an eyebrow.
	
	“What?” They’ll track you guys down for sure. That’s a terrible idea.”
	
	“Maybe so… but it’s out of my hands. I have one more thing I need to figure out,” he looked at Ajay. “One more thing I *need* to figure out. For his sake. Trust me.”
	
	Clint sighed. “Fair enough.”
	
	“Well… you want me to come along?” I asked.
	
	Sandhu smiled at me. “Nah. This is something we need to do on our own.”
	
	“Well…” I responded. “It’s been a ride man.”
	
	It felt weird saying bye to him like this.
	
	“Yeah. Sure has. But if things work out, you’ll definitely see me again.”
	
	And just like that, everything had been settled. Sandhu and Ajay were headed back to Earth. Their exact destination? Well, I’d rather not say it on here. Kael was headed to Gehenna in order to join the Deliverance. Pete stayed on the Desert-planet in order to continue his shooting. Once Clint had fixed his transporter, Him, Ken and Bella went off to god knows where.
	
	Well, to be more accurate, I went with them as well, but things got complicated pretty quickly and we got separated.
	
	So where am I now?
	
	That’s a long story for another time.
	
	But… I think things will work out in the end. At least, I *hope* they do.

Why the hell was Craig pricked Part 1

	Part 5-https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ch6bb0/what_the_hell_pricked_me_finale/
	
	
	Second of all, I want to say that I am sorry. I am sorry I left you all hanging in my previous post. I just couldn’t type anymore of my story because of shock from reading the text I received from Craig.
	
	Questions swamped my mind as I read the text over and over again.
	
	Is Bathym still on earth? How did he survive the Pope’s sweat? Why had he decided to go after Craig?
	
	After snapping out of my initial shock I desperately tried calling Craig several times. I wanted to warn him that what pricked him are no roses at all. I wanted to tell him to run as fast as he can to the nearest church and get help. But all my calls went straight to voicemail.
	
	I could feel the air being sucked out of my room. I could hear the sound of my heart beat in my ears. I called my father and lucky enough he answered his phone. I told him of my concern and asked him to check on Craig. My father assured me he will get right to it. I told him to take as many crucifixes as he can and asked him to update me as soon as he has spoken with Craig. He assured me he will.
	
	All I could do was wait for feedback from my father and pray for Craig. I couldn’t stomach the idea of what I went through happening to someone else. In fact this was not just someone else, this was the guy who had always sat with me during lunchtime back in high school when no one else wanted to. This was a guy who shared my pain and struggles during those awful teenage years. A guy I got bullied with and even stood up for me several times. A guy who always shared his fascinating stories and lightened me up even during my darkest of days. A guy who even asked Marjory Brown to go to the prom with me because I was too much of a coward to ask her myself (she rejected me of course, but I appreciated Craig’s help). This was a guy who made my high school life not a boring and lonely experience.
	
	This was also someone who I had just spent some quality time with a few days ago and he told me about his job, his wife and children. Even though I had been estranged to him for a while after high school, he is the one person I can say was and is my friend.
	
	I was very concerned about Craig. He was the one who initially led me away from a religious life. His parents were atheists, so was he. During one of our many lunchtime discussions back in high school, he had convinced me that they is no God. Being the fallible minded fool I was, I quickly accepted his line of thinking. Ever since then, I had abandoned my faith.
	
	Even when I met him a few days ago, he said he still doesn’t believe in God and tried to persuade me away from my faith again. But having seen and experienced what I had with the roses, I was not to be moved. So I knew that Craig's chances of removing Bathym from his body before the demon fully possessed him are slim. Unless if atheists have their own ways of exorcising demons.
	
	I told Rebecca and Joseph about the text message I received from Craig. Both of them were stunned.
	
	“It can’t be. The Pope’s sweat should have done away with that bozo,” Joseph said.
	
	Rebecca clenched her fists and uttered, “If that demon is still here on earth we have to exorcise him.” The jaundice in her voice suggested that she desperately wanted to avenge her father.
	“I agree but I am not drinking the Pope's sweat again,” I said recalling the bitter taste of that liquid in my mouth.
	
	“I don’t think we can get that anymore,” Rebecca replied. “My father was well connected and liked. I think he had to pull several strings to get that jar. I am not sure the Bishop will give any of us another jar.”
	
	“Okay fine, we should gather all the demon trackers, go back to my hometown and hope that all our weapons would be enough to kill this damn demon,” I suggested.
	
	“That also won’t work. Most of the trackers have left the city. I heard there is another powerful demon in some desolate town up North that needs several people to take it down. By the time they get back, it may be too late for your friend,” Rebecca said.
	
	It’s then I remembered that Patrick had said something about leaving the city for a few days. It was probably because of that. This also meant I could skip work for a while and not get into trouble.
	
	“So what should we do?” I asked.
	
	“I think we can kill him ourselves. If he did survive from the Pope's sweat he should be very weak. It could take weeks or months for him to regain his strength. With the weapons we have, I am sure we can still send him back to hell,” Rebecca said with the bitterness still evident in her tone.
	
	“Then let’s do it!” Joseph yelled.
	So that was what we had planned, to attack Bathym while he was still weak and finish him off with our holy water soaked rubber bullets. However, things didn’t quite go according to plan. As we prepared to leave, the new pastor arrived.
	
	I don’t usually like speaking badly about people but this man was an asshole with a capital A. By his accent I could tell he was British, he had thinning grey hair, sky blue eyes, a hunched back and his saggy skin suggested he was no spring chicken. He called all of us to the lounge for a meeting where he introduced himself as Father Henry Moffat. He bragged about how long he has been a pastor for the church. He also vaunted about how he comes from a family of powerful pastors and influential men in the Catholic Church.
	
	Apparently his great grandfather was one of the first missionaries to preach the word of God in Africa. I am not sure that is something pastor Moffat was supposed to boast about because it meant that his great grandfather was involved with British Colonialism in a way. But we didn’t interrupt the priest to point this out, we all let him talk proudly about his family. When he was done, he then asked me and Joseph of what we do at the church.
	
	“Handymen,” Joseph replied.
	
	“Both of you?” Father Moffat asked.
	
	We hadn’t really talked about what we will tell him about me, so I just played along with Joseph's idea. We both nodded out heads.
	
	“Really? Your hands are rather soft for a handyman,” the pastor said frowning at me.
	
	Joseph laughed and replied, “Well, my co-worker here struggles with masturbation. We are still praying for him to overcome it.”
	
	Father Moffat grimaced in disgust and wiped his hands on his black baggy trousers as if to show he regretted shaking hands with me.
	
	“And what happened to your hand?” the pastor fired another question pointing at my plastered limb.
	
	Joseph laughed and replied again, “also masturbation.”
	
	The pastor snapped at Joseph, “I was not talking to you, was I?! I am sure he can speak for himself!”
	
	“I am his roommate and if needs be, I can speak for him. It’s the roommate code,” Joseph replied.
	
	“Roommate? You two stay inside the house?” the pastor asked.
	
	Joseph and I exchanged quick glances and we nodded.
	
	“Why is that?”
	
	Joseph and I looked at each other again.
	“As handymen you should be residing at your own quarters.” The pastor stretched his long bony hand to point outside the window. “I think you will find that shade to be most befitting for men of your……profession.”
	
	I was irate to the extent of my face turning red. Not only was this man delaying us from going to kill Bathym but he was now chasing us out of the house. Rebecca and Joseph were about to protest but I spoke up first. We could argue with the pastor about our new accommodation later but there was something more important we needed to attend to.
	
	“Excuse me Father, you actually arrived when we were just about to head out. We have to go-“
	
	“On leave!” Joseph blurted out before I could finish.
	
	I got the impression that father Moffat didn’t know about demon tracking and Joseph wanted to keep it this way.
	
	“Leave? The both of you?” the priest asked.
	
	We all nodded our heads including Rebecca. The pastor turned to her and said she can’t leave because she has to brief him about everything regarding the church. I could tell Rebecca was annoyed but she didn’t argue.
	
	As for me and Joseph, the pastor demanded that we write him a letter stating the reasons why we are going on leave at the same time. We spent most of the day moving our stuff into the shed behind the house. The shed which was barely big enough to swing a cat had a roof and walls made purely of wood. We only finished moving our stuff into the shed in the early hours of the night. Father Moffat had insisted that we write the letter after we have moved out of the house. The man had not even off loaded his suitcase yet but he was already pushing my every button.
	
	I delegated the task of writing the letter to Joseph while I tried to call Craig again. My calls still went to voicemail. My body began to shiver when both of my parents were not picking up their phones. My stomach was rolling with anxiety as I wondered if it was a good idea to ask them to check on Craig. It only put them at risk.
	
	I pushed Joseph to finish the letter so we could be on our way. When he was done, he took the letter to the pastor. I kept trying to call my parents and Craig but to no prevail.
	
	Joseph came back and told me the pastor refused to approve the letter. When I read the letter he wrote, I found out why. Joseph had written that we are married to the same woman and she is not feeling well, so we are going visit her. I couldn’t even bring myself to be angry with him because I would only be wasting more time. I settled down to write the letter myself using my not so good left hand but almost immediately there was a knock on the door.
	
	Joseph went to answer it and said it was for me. When I went to the door, I realized our visitor was a police officer. He was short but well built. He had black Caesar cut hair, dark brown eyes and a round baby face which was cleanly shaven.
	
	“Stanford Black?” he asked in a sharp militant voice.
	
	I nodded.
	
	“You will have to come with me, sir.”
	
	Before I could speak, Joseph asked, “What is this about?”
	
	“It has nothing to do with you, sir,” the police officer answered dismissively as he gestured for me to head out of the shed.
	
	“Well, he is my roommate and I deserve to know, it’s the roommate code,” Joseph said.
	
	“Am I under arrest?” I asked.
	
	The officer breathed out in frustration, “look sir, you have to come with me or I will have to use force.” He said the words as he placed his right hand on his gun holster.
	
	“Okay fine, I will come with you,” I replied not wanting to escalate the situation.
	
	“I will also come with you. Roommates stick together, roommate code,” Joseph said.
	
	The officer didn’t object and he led us to his cruiser. We sat in the back as the police officer drove us downtown. But he didn’t take us to the police station. The officer parked in a dark alley in between fast food restaurants. He opened my door and told me to climb out. He prevented Joseph from exiting and locked him inside the car. The officer gestured for me to go to the black Impala parked further down the alley. I trudged over to the car worried sick of what was going on. As I got closer, I realized someone was standing outside the 1967 Chevrolet Impala.
	The man had a flat manilla file in his hand and cigar on the side of his mouth. He was wearing a white shirt with rolled up sleeves, blue suspenders and a loosely hang black tie. He had more hair on his arms than on his head and his stomach was big enough to put an eight month pregnant woman to shame. His blue eyes looked up as I approached him and he smiled.
	
	“So this is the famous Stanford Black. I have read and heard a lot about you,” he said as he threw the file on the roof of his car and folded his arms.
	
	“I am sorry you have at a disadvantage,” I said.
	
	He chuckled, “oh of course. I captain Steven Ledger. Father Hernandez was a dear friend of mine, may he rest in peace.”
	
	That was when I realized this was father Hernandez's police contact.
	
	“I thought it best we meet and talk, face to face. I heard what you did to Candice Stone.”
	
	My stomach tightened at the mention of Candice.
	
	“I also know of what you did in Jerry's internet café.”
	
	Again my stomach constricted.
	
	The police captain could sense my uneasiness and said, “don’t worry. If I wanted to arrest you, you would have been in some hell hole by now. Trust me, I am a guy who gets it. The world is full of…evil and people like you deal with it in your own ways to keep everyone else safe. However, I want you to know that I won’t be very understanding to anymore of your transgressions by that I mean the killings. No more people should die from your exorcisms or whatever you do to possessed folks. I am glad to see you put a cast on that hand, it shows me you are not a killer.”
	
	“Well, I am happy to know you are an understanding man because I need your help. The demon that was haunting me and killed father Hernandez is still out there and I think it has got my friend. We can use all the help we can get, especially police help.”
	
	“Sorry son. I am not a demon hunter or whatever you guys call yourselves. I also prefer few to none police officers being mired in all this demon business, so I can’t really help you there. I can however help you leave the city.”
	
	I was shocked that he knew that pastor Moffat was making it difficult for us to leave. He weakly smiled at me as if to say, ‘I know everything, kid.’
	
	“Officer Richards, will take you back to the church and you should be able to leave the city with no problem. Here is my number, give me a call sometime and remember no more human casualties,” the captain said as he handed me a business card with his contact details.
	
	I thanked him and walked back to the cruiser. I told Joseph everything as officer Richards drove us back to the church. When we arrived we got no problems from the Simon Cowell accented pastor. This made me respect Captain Ledger because whatever he did or say to the pastor it made him tame like a wet puppy. We loaded the truck with all our weapons and left. Rebecca couldn’t come with us because the pastor was adamant that she stays. I couldn’t even properly say goodbye to her because pastor Moffat was watching us like a hawk before we left.
	It was close to 3 A.M in the morning when we hit the highway. I was as tired as I could get. Joseph was driving, I couldn’t because of my hand. Frustrated that my calls to both Craig and my parents were going to voicemail, I decided to sleep for a while. Before I slept, I prayed to God for help in our mission. We had fewer weapons than the last time we journeyed to fight the demon and our plan wasn’t all that solid. In fact we didn’t even have a proper plan. I just prayed that Jesus would lead the way.
	
	When I woke up, the sun had risen. I realized someone was resting their head on my shoulder. I looked over at the driver seat and it wasn’t Joseph driving. In fact Joseph was seated in between me and the driver. He was using my shoulder as a pillow and as always he was snoring loud enough to shake the earth.
	
	The man behind the wheel had long straight black hair, his cheeks were covered by a well-trimmed beard and he was wearing a long white shirt that looked like a gown on his slender body.
	
	“Jesus?” I muttered.
	
	The man smiled at me and exclaimed, “Oh hi dude, you are awake! My name is Nathan but you can call me Nat.” His raspy voice reminded me of Shaggy from Scooby-Doo. His brown eyes had a shade of red which led me to think the guy was probably high as a kite.
	
	I quickly sat upright and shook off my grogginess. I prodded Joseph to wake up. “Who the hell is this?” I asked him.
	
	Joseph rubbed his eyes and looked over at the man driving the truck and then back to me. “That’s Nat,” he replied as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.
	“You let a stranger drive the car?!”
	
	“He is not a stranger, he is Nat. I just told you that. Besides I was tired and I already checked, he is not crazy or possessed.”
	
	“It’s true dude, I am not crazy but actually I am totally possessed…...with music. I am a great DJ. If you ever need me to play at your parties, I am game, free of charge my dude,” Nat said.
	
	“You see? He is cool,” Joseph said.
	
	I wanted to shout my head off at the both of them but the truck began to sputter, white smoke emanated from the bonnet and eventually the car came to a stop. Joseph and Nat checked on the problem while I tried to call Craig and my parents, I still had no luck.
	
	Joseph told me that the truck won’t be going anywhere anytime soon. Apparently the previous crush we had on the oak tree in my parent’s neighborhood had caused some damage that was overlooked when the truck was repaired.
	
	Joseph put his hand on my shoulder and said, “I know you are thinking of giving up (I wasn’t) but don’t lose hope (I hadn’t). We will find a way. Heroes like us always do.”
	
	“Uhm okay. Your zipper is open, man,” I said to him.
	
	He looked down and replied, “I know, it’s broken.”
	
	“So why are you wearing those pants?”
	
	“Because they are my lucky pants.”
	
	I deeply exhaled out of frustration, worry and weariness. I hadn’t been paying attention to Nat but the next time I looked over at him he had waved down a big old yellow school bus.
	
	Joseph leaned into me and said it’s because of his lucky pants that the bus stopped for us. I ignored him and quickly carried our luggage to the bus.
	
	When we got inside, we realized the bus was full of nuns. All of them were old enough to have attended high school with Jesus himself. They were also very sweet women because they agreed to give us a ride to our exact destination.
	
	We sat on the vacant three leather seats in the front. It then came to my attention that all the nuns in the bus were drinking tea from white demitasses. The head nun offered us some tea which Joseph and Nat took without hesitation. I had initially refused but the nuns repeatedly persuaded me until I relented.
	
	After just three sips of the sweet tea, my vision became bleary. Less than ten seconds later, I passed out.
	
	When I woke up, the sun was setting. The bus was shaking to suggest that we were moving on a rough road and my hands were tied behind my back. I looked outside and saw we were off the highway. The bus was riding down a dirt road of a wooden area filled with an assortment of tall fruitless trees.
	I noticed Joseph and Nat were both still passed out. They were also tied up like me. I couldn’t see where our bags with our weapons were.
	
	When I stared at the head nun seated to our right, a chill swept through my soul. Her eyes were blinding black. He face was crunched into a wrinkled frown like she had been constipated for the past week. I turned my head around and realized all the nuns in the bus now had black eyes and hideously ridged faces.
	
	Joseph and Nat woke up at the same time. They went through the same shock realization of our situation.
	
	“What is going on?” Nat hysterically asked.
	
	The nuns began laughing. “You are about to die,” the head nun said with a nefarious robotic voice I had come to realize all possessed people use. The rest of the nuns chuckled like a group of witches and it made my body quaver.
	
	“Oh my God, dudes,” Nat said. I think they are demons. Don’t worry, I read somewhere that if we can guess their names we will have power over them. Gary, Peter, Jack, Phillip, Rachel, Juliet-“
	
	“Please stop,” I begged him.
	
	“Sarah, Carol, David, Leonard, Larry, Tom, Tommy, Thompson!-“
	
	“Just shut up! It’s not going to work!” I screamed at Nat.
	“You better untie us now. My roommate knows the Pope on a ‘I can drink your sweat bases' and he will report you,” Joseph said.
	
	The head nun slapped Joseph so hard across the face, I thought his skin will peel off.
	
	“You think I am joking? Roomie, call the man.”
	
	“Oh, shut up Joseph. We need to-,” I trailed off when I realized the bus was slowing down.
	
	We had reached a derelict farm house built of red bricks and a grey asbestos roof. It had a spacious yard filled with empty barns, fowl runs, pig sties and kennels. The fields next to the house were devoid of any form of vegetation and were nothing but dust.
	
	The nuns violently ushered us out of the bus and led us to a large brick well behind the house. The top of the well was covered with huge metal plates and thick rusting chains. The nuns easily removed the metal plates and chains like birthday wrappings. They were whistling and laughing so loudly that I could barely hear what Joseph was screaming at them. It was already nightfall but I could tell inside the well was much darker.
	
	The nuns cut Nat loose and he screamed as he was thrown into the black abyss of the well. Joseph was also cut loose and hurled in next.
	
	Before I was tossed in, one of the nuns shouted, “Dinner is served!”
	I was freed from my restrains and aggressively chucked into the well. The fall was long. For several seconds I wailed as I sank into the blackness. I eventually landed with a loud and agonizing thump at the bottom of the well. Despite the pain aching throughout my whole body, I was thankful the well was dry.
	
	My mind was still in a haze but it didn’t stop me from smelling it. The stench that I had become so accustomed to. The stench of a rotten egg. The stench that always caused a knot to form on my throat. The stench that had meant the same thing every time I smelt it.
	
	The stench of danger.
	
	The stench of evil.
==================================================
Late night in the Morgue

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpjtkf/late_night_in_the_morgue/


	I'm sure you guessed already but I work in a hospital as a Doctor. No, I'm no forensic pathologist, but I was originally training to be one before I decided I preferred the living instead and assisting them.  But after years of med school, I have found myself working in this small hospital sometimes assisting the incompetent forensic pathologist we have here. Sometimes they won't be sure of something so they ask me to double-check or I've spotted a huge mistake in the deceased's medical files and have had to check the bodies personally to find the real issues. This has been going on for years though and is honestly pretty casual in my hospital that I assist in the alternate field.  I never enjoy it though, despite the preservation of the bodies with cooling, they still smell.  It was late on Saturday night, well past my time to leave, my shift had ended 3 hours ago but Ralph messed up again. I've put in several complaints about his casual misconduct and sheer stupidity but somehow he remained to keep me up fixing his mistakes. The patient in question Quentin Ramirez was shot to death by police. He was a homeless crazy who stabbed a woman in the chest 6 times and was shot 8 times by police from what I recall. Ralph had his cause of death written as heart failure the idiot. I took a look at him, he had the stitching from the autopsy forming that capital 'Y' on his chest and seven bullet wounds across his torso, 5 in the guts and 7 in his chest, 2 in his left thigh, the last was just above his eyebrow. I understand why he had to be killed, I understand he was out of control and had already killed a civilian but 15 times seemed unnecessarily excessive. 1,2 or 3 should be the most you have to shoot someone. I overheard some staff speaking about Ramirez saying he was already down when two other officers arrived and let off a couple of rounds to be safe. It's like a madhouse in here.  Ramirez was a thin, elderly Latino man, aged 66 and only 100 pounds. His body was nothing special. He was thin, you could almost make out his rib cage, his skin was sun-browned from years of not using sun cream and just letting himself burn under the sun. He had several scars along his forearms, hands and fingers. X-rays showed that the bones appeared to have been broken several times and all healed improperly. The joints looked above average thickness and size. Like the bones had reconstructed themselves far too many times. Similar activity appeared in his skull specifically the forehead. But on the outside, there were no visible signs of this. He didn't appear big-boned, his hands weren't large or swollen and neither was his forehead. I was sick of this. There was nothing to discuss. Quentin Ramirez had an odd bone structure and was shot to death. I called Ralph this time to maybe think about how much of an idiot he could be. I used the phone from his desk and began ringing, the first time nothing but the second time he quickly picked up. "Yeah what?" He groaned.
	"Hey, it's me, Thomas." I said, "Hey it's like midnight, you know I start early cause of traffic, what is it?"
	"Guess where I am?... I'm fixing your fuck up... you listed Quentin Ramirez's cause of death under heart failure. He was shot to death. He even has a bullet wound in his skull!"
	"Hey... just listen, man, it looks like a screw up I know but lemme talk."
	"What the hell is there to talk? 15 times he was shot!"
	"Yeah, he stabbed a girl in front of a cop, dragged her away and kept stabbing her. He called for back up and once the old bastard dropped the woman the cop shot him in the head..." Ralph said pausing for my response
	"Congratulations, a guy gets shot in the head and you still list it as heart failure," I said cynically
	"NO! He didn't go down. Why do you think other cops even arrived and shot him. 3 cops and 14 more bullets. He wouldn't go down. He even ran at them. Then he just stopped. He had a goddamn heart attack. But something was happening to his hands and forehead. Cops couldn't explain so we got the X-rays. I told em what I found and they said that couldn't explain it."
	"Oh man you know I don't believe any of that crap."
	"I'm serious, check out the police report and check out his heart. Talk to me again in the morning I'm done with this weird shit today." Ralph hung up.
	I was about done with his shit when I slammed the phone on his desk. I was reading through the police report and everything he had just told me was true. Ramirez was unstoppable. 15 rounds all hits including a headshot. But there was something about his hands and forehead. Something was growing from his forehead and his hands were large, sharp and glowing. What the actual fuck I thought to myself. Was this some kind of messed up joke gone way too far I originally thought.
	But then I decided to take a second look at Ramirez's body specifically his arms and forehead. I moved his long matted grey hair away from his face and held a small light to his forehead. I found scars just under his hairlines two of them both recent they couldn't have been older than a year or so. They looked like exit wounds like something had forced its way out. I lifted his head to search for anything that could've penetrated the back of his skull. Nothing.
	The room felt colder, I even felt a shiver crawl its way up my spine. I decided that it was late and that I would look further into the possibility of heart failure then discuss it later with Ralph. I had to get some sleep.
	I closed Ramirez into his drawer. I packed up and cleaned the equipment I used and was about to leave when I was caught staring at the floor. It was covered in a black fog, it wasn't smoke, it wasn't rising to the ceiling, nothing smelt like it was burning if it was smoke I definitely would've smelt it by now. The room instead got only colder. I could see my breath thicker before it was barely noticeable now great white whisps were pouring out.
	I panicked as the black fog grew thicker and I could no longer make sense of the floor. It was so thick and then came the smell. The vile smell, it was gut-wrenching. I couldn't breathe through my mouth anymore it was disgusting. I tried rushing to the door but the fog slowed me, I was practically tripping over my own feet. I turned around to see the fog emanating all from Ramirez's draw. The corners of the small square door were spilling the fog out into the room. The smell became more familiar, it smelt like someone had been rotting.
	I froze in fear, it wasn't the cold that did this, if anything I preferred the cold in comparison to warm weather, so it didn't bother. The only thing that bothered me was the heavy breathing coming from Ramirez's drawer. It didn't sound natural, like a human's breathing at all. It was almost like a low growl. Then came the screaming, it was so deafening. One would think the drawer would muffle the sound in some way but then again everything that's happening right now shouldn't be happening. I wanted to run for the door again, to get out of whatever the fuck this was but the black fog erupted in front of the door covering it completely. It didn't fill the room, it only hid the door. I tried forcing my hands through it and feeling for the handle, but I couldn't feel anything, the door should've been there but there was nothing. I reached out to my elbows and still nothing. The door should've been right there, my hand should've been going through it, it was that close. But nothing.
	The screaming had stopped. Instead, there was a loud bang and a dent in the door holding Ramirez back. Again and again, more dents grew in the door until it finally flew off into the black fog covered floor. A burst of fog came out before it slowly filtered out like before. I nearly cried out like a madman when I saw the glowing red eyes hiding in the chamber. They were staring me down looking right through me. It hurt. It hurt to have that thing look at me. I just wanted it to go away, to shut its eyes and stay dead like it was supposed to. But then it's claw-like hands latched onto the sides of the opening. Twisted, jagged claws scraping the sides. It leapt out and stood tall. I was a blubbering mess, it wasn't tears or screaming, I was losing my damn mind.
	Ramirez's stitching had been pulled apart and his chest opened. Inside was an orange glow and a black ribcage. I looked up to his face and only saw horns. They were about 6 inches long, curving back past his fringe. The tips were glowing yellow like molten steel.
	He stared me down and retrieved a strange stone. It was a circle, like a sigil covered in strange markings all glowing red. Ramirez then found a scalpel and jabbed it into his shoulder, drawing out blood which he then wiped across the circular shaped stone whilst muttering something.
	
	
	He returned attention to me. He threw the table in front of him away effortlessly while still staring into my eyes still.
	
	"I'm sorry... but I have to kill it." He said to me as his horns and body began glowing more violently. He kneeled down to me. I still couldn't breathe from the fog, I could see that he was breathing but could feel no breath. His teeth appeared sharpened and larger but none of that mattered.
	
	His hand buried itself into my chest, ripping into me. I somehow still remained conscious. My eyes fixated on the horrid sight, I realised he wasn't mindlessly tearing away at me, he was making an incision. The pain broke me. I was screaming so loud for help, for anyone who might hear me. Someone must've been on this level showing up for a shift or maybe a janitor just cleaning. Anybody. Ramirez had finished opening up my chest. He then plunged his hand into the wound and pulled out my heart.
	
	I began tasting iron in my mouth from all of the blood filling it. My clothes were stained red, the only reason I couldn't see the new red splattered floor was because of the fog but I felt it. For some reason, the pain stopped but I could still see everything. I thought I was dead. I think it might've been too much for my brain process.
	
	Suddenly a knocking could be heard from the door beyond the cool room. "Anybody in there? Hey is everything okay? Heard screamin!" A guard called out.
	
	Ramirez slashed at the door behind me opening it and dragging me into the light-filled hallway directly in front of a security guard. "Holy fuck!" He yelled drawing his gun. I was only able to mumble the words "Don't let him kill me." Before Ramirez dragged me into the Janitors closet and covered the door with fog.
	
	"IN HERE! SOMETHING TOOK HIM INTO THE JANITOR CLOSET!" I heard the guard screaming for his pal.
	
	Ramirez got busy he took the sigil and placed it into my chest. I began to feel pain again. Something felt odd. Like my insides were crawling towards the sigil stone. Soon enough my wound closed itself but there was still burning in my chest.
	
	Ramirez stood up proud almost with a crazed smile across his face, his wounds were all gone. The gaping hole in his chest was all but gone, replaced with actual flesh. His horns had faded away like the black fog covering the door. The guard was still banging loudly against the door.
	
	"I did not want to hurt anyone else today but there is no other way to kill it." He said calmly as the guard burst in with his gun out, Ramirez jabbed him with the scalpel in the eye, retrieved the revolver from the guard and let him squirm in pain as he held his hands close to his eye but not daring to touch the scalpel. Ramirez drew the gun on me. The other guard, however, shot Ramirez before he could pull the trigger on me.
	
	"Suspect down, I need medical help here please!" He called out over his radio. I was still in shock, I couldn't move or think, it was all blank space to me for what seemed like hours or days. The next clear memory I have is whispering. I was in a hospital bed, staring at the wall, listening to something whisper in my head. "It's you and me now if you died I would find another, but he made us one. If you die, I die. I'm hungry... if we're going to survive I need something from you. All I can do is give you the strength to do it. Find them, find the wicked we need to cull them from the shepherd's herd."
	
	I haven't been a doctor for years, but hunting is a lucrative business, it keeps me well-fed, strong, and the herd is a little safer from the wolves.
==================================================
I am a police tactical operator, and I ventured into a place I wasn't supposed to. (Part 1)

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpjtao/i_am_a_police_tactical_operator_and_i_ventured/


	
	I have experienced a fair share of traumatizing scenes during my career in law enforcement, but this will be etched in the deepest part of my mind for as long as I live.
	
	
	As a front-line tactical unit of the local law enforcement, we are required to attend a week's training every two months. Part of the training curriculum includes urban combat which is usually conducted at abandoned schools, hospitals, etc.
	
	
	Before I go further, here's a brief history of this place: It was once known as Forestville Middle School, which totally fits its geography - right at the far edge of the town and adjacent to a forest where the military would occasionally conduct their training. *Hell, who in the right mind would even build a school here*. It was built about fifteen years ago, with full sponsorship from the government. Enrollment wasn't the best, but somehow sufficient for the school to barely survive.
	
	
	Then in the summer of '09, *the incident* happened - eight students disappeared from the school within a single day. Local law enforcement initially suspected kidnap, but no ransom calls were received. A search party was sent into the forest, but to no avail. The authorities eventually threw this case onto the "unsolved missing persons" pile and of course, this sparked off strong objections and protests from the public. The case was subsequently known as the "Forestville Disappearance", and the school was eventually shut down and vacated. **Everything** was removed from the compound, leaving behind an empty shell.
	
	
	"Wake up sleepyhead, we've arrived," said Harvey as he nudged me on my arm. I forced my eyes open and stumbled out of the car, letting out a big yawn while throwing my arms high up in the air for a good stretch.
	
	
	"C'mon you better start running! It's time for roll call!" bellowed the trainers.
	
	
	I sighed and dragged my lazy ass (as you can tell, not a morning person) to the assembly area located at the hall on level 2. After the grouchy trainers went through the usual mundane formalities (safety rules, emergency procedures, etc.), we were dismissed to do a ground sweep to ensure that there were no trespassers on the training grounds and to spot any potential safety hazard.
	
	
	My team was in-charge of the first level, and we split up to cover the entire area quicker. It wasn't our first time here, so it took me no time to complete my side of the sweep. As I exited the final classroom in the far corner of the west wing, something caught my eye - the metal gate at the stairs leading to the basement was ajar, with the old rusty padlock lying on the floor.
	
	
	Whenever we had training here, the trainers would emphasize one golden rule - never, ever, go down to the basement. Despite our persistent questionings, they had refused to tell us the reason. We eventually assumed they were simply afraid of mishaps because of the poor lighting down there. Knowing that filling up training injury reports isn't fun, we empathized with the trainers and complied with instructions.
	
	
	*I could have sworn that the padlock was on the gate when I passed it earlier.* Brushing it off, I walked up to close the gate and locked it with the padlock. That was when I heard it.
	
	
	Sobs and sniffles. To be exact, sobs and sniffles of a young boy, coming from the basement.
	
	
	"Hello kid? What are you doing down there? Do you need help?" I called out.
	
	
	No reply. Instead, the sounds grew fainter as if whoever made them was moving further away from me.
	
	
	"Hey! Come back! I'm here to help you!" I called out again.
	
	
	The sounds continued to fade until they completely disappeared.
	
	
	*Dammit*. At that moment, I had to make a decision: I could either return to call for backup, or rush down there before the boy went any further. I decided on the latter when I thought that the child was in distress and I couldn't afford to waste any time.
	
	
	*Wrong move. Just like the main character of every horror movie, stupid me was incapable of logical thoughts. Why the fuck would there be a young child in an abandoned middle school out in the middle of nowhere.*
	
	
	I rammed the padlock with the butt of my HK-MP5, the standard issue weapon of my unit. Thanks to its poor condition, the padlock gave way after three to four good hits. The gate swung open with a loud creak and I cautiously made my way down the stairs with the assistance of my trusty torchlight.
	
	
	The basement corridor was narrower than the other parts of the school, and the yellow-ish ceiling lights were slightly dimmer. Weirdly, there wasn't a single door along the corridor except for one at the very end. My inner-Sherlock deduced that the boy was inside that room, unless he could walk through the damned walls.
	
	
	I approached the door, reached for the knob, and slowly turned it - unlocked. I heaved a sigh of relief, knowing that he didn't lock himself inside. I gently pushed the door open and entered the room. That was when confusion hit me.
	
	
	It was empty.
	
	
	And I meant it literally. I was greeted by nothing but four blank walls and a ceiling light.
	
	
	"That's it," I thought to myself, "I'ma sleep early tonight."
	
	
	I turned around and made my way back to the first level, racking my brains to cook up a good reason why I busted the padlock. I assumed that "I imagined a boy's cries because of my lack of sleep" wasn't exactly a decent explanation.
	
	
	As I turned into the hallway of the first level, I froze.
	
	
	Firstly, there were lockers, benches, water dispensers, and everything else that weren't supposed to be there **anymore**. Secondly, it was pitch black outside the windows. If my memory served me right, it was fucking **0830 in the morning** when I had arrived here.
	
	
	I immediately knew something was wrong. *Terribly wrong*. There was no way I could have taken the wrong stairs up, because only a single flight of stairs connected the first level and basement.
	
	
	I was glued to the spot, mouth agape, trying to figure out what the heck was going on. When I finally got my senses back, I sprinted back to the entrance as fast as I could. As I dashed through the hallway, I caught a glimpse of the classrooms' interior - they were all filled with the typical classroom furniture, as if the school was never vacated to begin with.
	
	
	After what seemed like ages, I finally reached the main entrance of the school. And of course, the doors wouldn't budge. I stomp-kicked the hell out of them, but it felt like my legs would give way before the doors did. I peered out of the windows, trying to see the situation outside, and I was stared back by the darkness. *Pure darkness.*
	
	
	"What in the world..."
	
	
	I slumped against the doors in despair, unable to comprehend a single element of this situation. As I looked up at the split hallways leading to the east and west wings, I saw something else which wasn't present when I had first arrived at this god forsaken place - a banner hanging from the ceiling:

Silence in the Air

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpjsla/silence_in_the_air/


	
	8/14/22
	
	
	"CQ. CQ. KN4VEP. IF ANYONE IS OUT THERE, PLEASE RESPOND. CQ. CQ."
	
	The monotonous click of the key was starting to get on my nerves. I wasn't able to get any response since the Illinois ARES station went quiet. As far as I knew, I was the only one left in Tennessee. The other stations reported the same thing before going dark. Missouri was reporting that the grass had turned black, then cut off. Same with Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama, and now Illinois. The Sludge is not stopping any time soon. I still tried to use the internet, or what was left of it, from time to time. The only sites that still load somewhat are Reddit, Google, and a few old government sites. At least I could still type stuff on Reddit. A whole website, just for a diary. Imagine the ‘karma’ it would of gotten. I managed to chuckle a little before I shoved that thought into the back of my head; it hurts to remember the time before the Sludge.
	
	I repeated the message two more times, then shut the transceiver off. I grabbed the checklist- one of the only two things that I could have read around there - and started the normal shutdown procedures. Receiver on - check. Generators fueled and on - check. Long range antenna stowed... I needed to do that. I walked outside. Man, it was too cold to be doing this. I went to the barracks, climbed up to the top, and cranked the antenna down to its stowed position. I took a moment to look out over the lake. I remember the times when I used to run around the old fort. Now, all that was left was the rotting wooden walls, the armory and barracks, and one lonely ARES operator.
	
	I headed on back to the radio room in the old armory. Stow antenna - check. I put the checklist back on the table, and started making fishing lures. There wasn't much else to do, and the fish were still somewhat healthy. I was lucky that they took longer to become Affected. Then, the radio crackled to life.
	
	"SOS. SOS. LAT 35.92 N. LONG 84.69 W. GRASS IS BLACK. REPEAT - GRASS IS BLACK"
	
	Oh no... no no no no no.
	
	I immediately turned my receiver back on.
	
	"KN4VEP. SOS, WHEN WAS THIS" I was trying my best not to panic. It shouldn't have been there yet, not now.
	
	"R, KN4VEP. S IS HERE. WHAT IS LOCATION"
	
	"FORT SW POINT"
	
	"KN4VEP, EVACUATE WHILE YOU STILL CAN. IT IS HERE"
	
	"R. GOOD LUCK."
	
	"SAME. SOS SOS..."
	
	I jumped to action. I grabbed the key, receiver, the router, and my bug-out bag. I ran to the jeep, made sure the radio trailer and its generator was attached, and stowed everything in the trailer. I sprinted back, grabbed two gas cans, and placed them in the trunk. I jumped in, and started speeding down the highway. The plan is now to join up with the ARES in Savannah. They have an old nuclear powered submarine from before the Sludge, and plenty of fishing equipment. If things went south in Tennessee, then everyone was to head to Savannah to evacuate the mainland.
	
	I hope I am not too late.
	
	
	8/15/22
	
	
	I woke up at around six-ish. I wasn't sure about where I was, so I looked at the map and the road signs rusting next to the jeep. I was near the I-26 I-345 merge. That meant that I still had a day and a half left to make it to Savannah, as long as there wasn't another traffic jam of abandoned cars. I turn the key, and the jeep sputters to life. The ping of the mobile radio turning on startled me; I'll have to get used to this. I ate one of the emergency MREs from my bug-out bag. The gravy and biscuits were decent. I looked at the trees around the road. Some were wilting, but most still stood well. The leaves were long gone, as usual. Before I drove off, I made a few calls on the radio.
	
	"CQ. CQ. KN4VEP. Does anyone read me?"
	
	Static.
	
	"CQ. CQ. Kilo, November, 4, Victor, Echo, Papa. Does anyone read me?"
	
	Static again.
	
	I turned the radio off. I put the jeep in drive, and sped off again.
	
	The next few hours were monotonous. Occasionally, I had to weave in between abandoned cars. I hate the black ones. They were the hardest to see in the constant darkness. Then, I saw what I thought was impossible: it looked like a city’s lights were on. The glow was brighter than anything I had seen since the grid collapsed. I thought that all but the hydroelectric and wind plants died days after the Sludge appeared. I stopped to look at my map. If I remember correctly, then the city over there is Columbia. I was going to be passing by it on my way to Savannah. If it still had power, then maybe it would be a good place to resupply and make contact with Savannah.
	
	No.
	
	Columbia was burning. The Affected were there. Piles and piles of screaming and howling and agony were clawing against the flaming ruins, trying to snuff the light out. I had to flee. The screams are still ringing in my ears. All of the Affected… I cannot imagine the pain. I had to stop a few miles down the road. I threw up. Many times. Not here. Not this close. If only we had known in time. If only I had known what the sludge did. Maybe then, she would still be alive. The screams… The feeling of pure pain and agony… The … melting… I **hate** the sludge. If only I could stop it. If only I could have saved her. If only I could see her smile one more time. If only...
	
	…
	
	I eventually mustered the strength to look at the trees and grass. More trees were wilting than before. I needed to leave right then, or else… I shuddered at the thought.
	
	I went to the jeep. I put it in drive, and sped away as fast as I could.
	
	I hope that Savannah is still there.

Mr. Walbern

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpjrpl/mr_walbern/


	I've been a park ranger for about 7 years, and in my time, I've seen some serious stuff. Usually the calls were simple: there'd be a wild animal digging around the cabins or a tree had fallen over one of the trails, but every once in a while, someone would go missing. Most of the time we'd find them before the sun set, and the ones we didn't, well...
	
	Anyway, the point is, most of our calls were simple, but some of them, well, some of them were downright terrifying. I'm writing this here because I want it documented, and then I want to forget about it completely.
	
	It was a normal, boring day when we got the call - someone had rented cabin 13 and didn't check out at the time alloted for them. After being told the basic information, my partner and I were dispatched to go check it out and tell them it was time for them to leave. Making sure our radios and tasers were clipped to our belt, we hopped in the truck and set out.
	
	When we arrived at the cabin, everything looked mostly normal. The renter's car was in the pathway, and there was smoke coming from the chimney. The outhouse sat to the side of the cabin, the door hanging slightly ajar, swaying with the wind. The only thing that appeared strange was the windows. Mr. Walbern, the renter, seemed to have put cardboard up against every window, completely blocking them. Shaking my head at the weird preferences of people, we walked up to the cabin and knocked loudly.
	
	No response.
	
	"Park Rangers, is anybody there?" My partner called as he pounded his fist against the door for a second time. Still, no response. He looked at me and shrugged before taking out his master key. He unlocked the door and opened it just a crack. "Park Rangers, we're coming in Mr. Walbern."
	
	The cabin remained silent. Slowly, my partner stepped inside the cabin, and immediately jumped back out, his hands over his mouth. He ran down the steps and knelt by the surrounding bushes.
	
	I stood there, unsure of what to do. I peeked my head in the doorway and was hit with the most putrid smell I've ever experienced. I took a couple steps back, my arm over my nose, and stared at the darkness emitting from the doorway. What the heck?!
	
	After taking a moment to recover, my partner appeared back at my side on the porch, breathing heavily.
	
	"What... is that?" He panted. I shook my head, slowly unclipping my radio and bringing it up to my mouth.
	
	"Hey, HQ?" I said into the radio.
	
	"We read you, ranger," came the reply through the static.
	
	"We're going to need back up, and standby with the police and an ambulance," I said shakily.
	
	"Roger that."
	
	I clipped my radio back to my belt and looked at my partner. With a weary look, he pulled out his taser and turned on the flashlight function.
	
	"Wait, you're not going in there, are you? We should wait for back up," I said, holding my hand out.
	
	"What if someone's hurt?" He asked, a defeated look in his eyes. He didn't want to go in either, that was obvious, but he couldn't just stand here and do nothing. He pulled his shirt over his nose, turned away, and disappeared into the cabin.
	
	With a huff, I also pulled my shirt over my nose, took out my flashlight taser, and followed him. I immediately regretted my decision.
	
	The whole cabin was covered in blood, with piles splashed haphazardly around. I looked around, seeing the beam from my partner's flashlight in the bedroom, the only other room in the cabin. It was a simple layout: a large living room and kitchen area, with only one doorway that led to the master bedroom.
	
	I scanned the room with my flashlight, the pools of blood reflecting as I moved my beam. There was so much blood, I'll never forget it. There was no way it came from one person, either. If it even was from a person, that is. I didn't see anyone, living or dead. It was obvious Mr. Walbern had been here, his jacket was on the chair, keys were on the counter, and there was a half full glass of milk on the counter. Despite that, the house felt empty and cold, as if no one had been there for years.
	
	"Hey, you might want to come in here," my partner called from the other room, his voice cracking. Carefully, I made my way across the living room, doing my best not to step in any puddles of blood. When I entered the bedroom, I almost dropped my light.
	
	In the corner of the bedroom, slightly hidden by the bed, was a pile of dead deer. Not just one, but several, and all of them were missing their heads. I gagged and turned away, walking back through the living room and out onto the porch. My partner followed me out, pulling his shirt down to reveal a deep frown on his face. After giving me a couple of moments to process, he spoke.
	
	"This is disturbing."
	
	"No shit," I said, also pulling my shirt down. "What happened? What do we do?"
	
	"I don't know," he said. "I took a closer look at the deer before I called you in. Somethings not right about them."
	
	"What do you mean?" I asked.
	
	"Well," he began, his frown deepening. "All of those deer were killed within the last day or so, and from my hunting experience, I'd say they're all does. And what's more disturbing, there seemed to be bite marks all over their bodies."
	
	"Bite... marks?" I stared at him, my eyes stretched wide.
	
	"Yeah." He took a deep breath and continued. "They seemed to be about the size of a human mouth."
	
	I immediately radioed in for a call to the police station, and seconds after clipping my radio back to my belt, our back up arrived.
	
	-------
	
	We never found Mr. Walbern, even though the police searched for weeks. Normally, we don't get the "after" information, but my friend at the station filled me in on the details, and I wish he hadn't. DNA testing from the blood didn't match Mr. Walbern or the deer, which left the police wondering where it all came from. What did come up as a match, however, were the dental imprints of the bite marks. They belonged to Mr. Walbern.
	
	The deer were disposed of, and the cabin was cleaned out to be rented again. Months passed, and the case went cold. Occasionally, renters of cabin 13 would report hearing scratches and scuffles outside, and many would complain about a horrible smell coming from the floorboards. Some would even report seeing a man standing outside their windows at night, just staring.
	
	We never found Mr. Walbern, and I don't think we ever will. I quit my job a year later, shortly after another lone renter from cabin 13 went missing, and I'm now happily working far away from the woods.
	
	I'm not putting this up as a warning, nor do I want attention. But if you do happen to see Mr. Walbern, turn around and stay far, far away from him.

People in My Community Are Going Missing [Part 3]

	[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dik6q0/people_in_my_community_are_going_missing_part_2/)
	
	Hi folks! I just wanted to update, I did manage to finish my homework…
	
	Also, I’m not sure if you remember the kids’ friends, Mitzy and Tomas. I asked Luisa and it looks like that family used to live in the same apartment complex, but the parents were taken by ICE and the kids had to go live with a relative on the other side of town. Luisa didn’t want the kids to be scared of people in uniforms (in case they need help from the cops because you never know), so she told them the Llorona story to explain what happened. I asked around to see why the neighbor guy was knocking on doors and if anyone else had seen him. No one recognized the man I described. Of course, I didn’t get a chance to ask all the neighbors; police had arrested some people in the complex, but no one is sure if it was immigration-related or something else. The feeling around here has been very tense and uneasy.
	
	I’m back at Luisa’s watching the kids tonight since she picked up another shift. It’s Halloweek, so Julie had to finish decorating a paper Jack O’Lantern. Isaiah’s homework was not as fun. He had to finish a math worksheet and writing exercise. We were working at the table when we heard the shower start running in the bathroom. We paused and looked at each other.
	
	I got up and left the kids at the table to see what was going on in the bathroom. The curtain was closed and the shower was running. I could see the water splashing onto the curtain, but it looked like nothing else was in there. I figured the faucet was loose and opened on its own. I would have to let Luisa know so she could get it fixed. I opened the curtain
	
	“Oh, shit!” I jumped back and looked away. Behind that curtain was the woman I had seen before. Her head was tilted up towards the shower head, the water drops peeling her dead skin from her face. Her eyeless sockets were staring right at me. She had no eyes, but something was there, piercing my soul and turning my blood cold. Slowly, I turned back towards the shower and saw that it was empty, no one was there. I took in a quick breath and opened the rest of the curtain. Empty. I turned off the water and gave both handles an extra turn to keep them shut. I turned and Isaiah was there.
	
	“Ay! You scared me, Isaiah!”
	
	He laughed “Sorry, Tia Yoli.”
	
	“What happened?”
	
	“We heard you scream, are you ok?”
	
	“Yes, I just saw a spider in the shower and got scared.” Isaiah’s face tensed up and his eyes widened. Maybe a spider wasn’t the best cover story, but I figured the ghost lady was even scarier.
	
	“But it’s ok,” I added, “I killed it. Here, let’s go back to the table.”
	
	We both walked back and sat at the table. Julie looked up from her project and asked if everything was ok.
	
	“Tia Yoli saw this huge spider in the shower and she killed it!”
	
	Julie, horrified, looked at me.
	
	“It’s ok, mija, there are no more spiders in the shower.”
	
	“But why was the water on? Was the spider taking a shower?”
	
	I laughed, “No, I think the handles are loose. It happens sometimes.”
	
	She didn’t seem convinced, so I knew I would have my work cut out for me during bath time.
	
	I texted Luisa about the shower and we worked for another hour, until both kids were done with their work. Julie finished early, so I had her help me make paper Halloween decorations for the apartment. Once Isaiah finished, he helped us put up the decorations. We were done pretty quickly.
	
	“Tia Yoli, can we carve pumpkins?”
	
	“We need pumpkins for that, Isaiah, plus we would need to use knives. I’ll need to ask your mom if it’s ok.”
	
	“I asked her and she said it’s fine.”
	
	I looked over at Isaiah and smiled, “I’m sure she did, I need to hear it from her first and then see when we can carve them. She might want to carve a pumpkin too.”
	
	I glanced at my phone and saw a new message. I opened it and it was Luisa about the shower.
	
	\*It’s been doing that all week. Hopefully they’ll fix it soon. Turn the handle in the middle all the way to the right. It’s for the bath faucet, that should help.\*
	
	I sent back a thumbs up emoji.
	
	“I’ll be right back, I’m going to go check on the-“
	
	The shower started running again. The kids laughed, it was pretty good timing. I wanted to laugh too, but I couldn’t shake this uneasy feeling I had in my stomach. I smiled at them and pointed towards the bathroom before walking that way. I walked into the bathroom and froze. The curtain was closed like before and it appeared empty, like it had earlier. I grabbed a tall candle from the sink, poked the curtain with it, and jumped back. Nothing. I tried again, but poked the curtain a few more times. The shower had to be empty. I flung the curtain open and held the candle in front of me. Just water running from the shower head. I turned the handles and made sure the middle one was all the way to the right. I turned one of the other handles to make sure no more water was coming out of the shower head, just the bath faucet. I turned the handles as tightly as I could. As I stood back up, I felt something cold and slick part my hair from the back and place itself on my neck. I jumped and fell into the bathtub. I looked back and nothing was there. I rubbed the back of my neck and it felt clammy. Isaiah and Julie rushed in.
	
	“Tia Yoli! Are you ok? Did you fall down?”
	
	They came over to help me up, but they’re little, so I helped myself up while they grabbed at my clothes or pulled my arms. I thanked them for their help and we walked back to the table. I was limping slightly, my knee and forearm had slammed right up against the tub. I went to the kitchen to put ice in a bag for my arm and knee. Julie and Isaiah looked at me, worried. I was not about to tell them about the wet thing on my neck.
	
	“I’m ok, babies, the water got everywhere and I slipped. We’ll have to make sure it stays dry so no one else gets hurt.”
	
	They nodded in agreement. I looked at my phone. It was almost time for them to get ready for bed. I wasn’t sure how I was going to manage bath time with all the weird stuff going on in there. I feel silly typing this out now. It’s so obvious I should have taken the kids with me and gone to my mom’s or something. At the time, it just seemed like something less sinister and more annoying.
	
	“Time to get ready for bed, come on, let’s go!”
	
	Both kids groaned.
	
	“I’ll read you any story you want, I brought some Halloween books from the library. But you have to –“
	
	The kids bolted up and ran to the bathroom to brush their teeth, I limped after them, pressing the ice bag against my arm.
	
	Once they finished, I sat on the edge of the tub to bathe Julie. Once she was done, I had Isaiah bathe with the door open, just in case something weird happened. I helped her into her PJs by the door, occasionally glancing into the bathroom. Isaiah’s figure through the curtain was alone and upright. When he was done, I had him finish drying in the bedroom while I tightened the shower handles closed, even making sure the middle one was turned all the way to the right. Once Isaiah was dressed, I got both kids tucked into beds, ready for story time. They chose a cheesy book about ghosts and witches planning a Halloween party. The pictures were pretty funny, which we all enjoyed. I hugged them both good night and turned out the lights.
	
	I walked towards the living room when I heard water running in the bathroom. I turned on the light and looked around. The water was coming from the shower, but just the lower faucet. The curtain was not drawn all the way, the faucet and handles were visible from the door. I could have sworn those handles were shut tight! I could hear the water flow splashing onto water, it had been running for a while. I walked over and as I reached for the handle, a hand with rotting flesh grabbed my wrist and tried to pull me down towards the tub. I tried to pull away and I felt another clammy hand pull my shirt over my head. I struggled against the hands, but they were too strong and pulled me into the shower. I heard the door to the bathroom slam closed. My heart was beating into my throat. I couldn’t see anything with my shirt covering my face. My arms were restrained by the shirt. The shower head turned on, cold water started running down my back and soaking into my shirt. A hand pulled my head back and the shirt absorbed the water. I started choking. Panic coursed through my body as I realized what was happening. I started kicking, trying to get out of this death trap. The corners of my vision started going black. No, I had to fight this. If I died, this would happen to the kids too. I couldn’t imagine anything bad happening to them. I kicked at the handles, trying to turn them off. I felt my body getting more limp, the black spots in my vision spreading. I twisted and kicked the shower wall, my back slapped the linoleum on the bathroom floor. Water popped out of my mouth and spread over my face. I pulled the wet fabric from my head and tried to get up, but I must have passed out. The next thing I knew, someone was crying right next to me. But I knew that cry, I recognized it.
	
	“Julie? Is that you?”
	
	She kept crying. I squeezed my eyes shut and sat up. The head rush was bad. I leaned up against the wall and looked over at her. Julie’s face was red and puffy. She looked terrified, I opened an arm out and she came in for a hug. I took in deep breaths and tried to wrap my head around what just happened.
	
	I must have been laying there a long time. Luisa came home pretty soon after and was very confused to find me drenched, in my bra, on the bathroom floor, with her crying daughter. Not a good look.
	
	She managed to calm Julie down and put her to bed. I grabbed a towel to wrap around my shoulders and waited for Luisa in the living room. When she came back, I explained everything that happened. She silently listened until I finished.
	
	“You know, Yoli, Julie kept saying the same thing over and over again. When she found you on the floor, she heard crying coming from the shower, but no one was there. It scared her to see you like that and to hear that crying. I think it’s time to call the Candelarias.”

I am a police tactical operator, and I ventured into a place I wasn't supposed to be. (Part 1)

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpjpeb/i_am_a_police_tactical_operator_and_i_ventured/


	I have experienced a fair share of traumatizing scenes during my career in law enforcement, but this will be etched in the deepest part of my mind for as long as I live.
	
	
	As a front-line tactical unit of the local law enforcement, we are required to attend a week's training every two months. Part of the training curriculum includes urban combat which is usually conducted at abandoned schools, hospitals, etc.
	
	
	Before I go further, here's a brief history of this place: It was once known as Forestville Middle School, which totally fits its geography - right at the far edge of the town and adjacent to a forest where the military would occasionally conduct their training. *Hell, who in the right mind would even build a school here*. It was built about fifteen years ago, with full sponsorship from the government. Enrollment wasn't the best, but somehow sufficient for the school to barely survive.
	
	
	Then in the summer of '09, *the incident* happened - eight students disappeared from the school within a single day. Local law enforcement initially suspected kidnap, but no ransom calls were received. A search party was formed to search the forest, but to no avail. The authorities eventually threw this case onto the "unsolved missing persons" pile and of course, this sparked off strong objections and protests from the public. The case was subsequently known as the "Forestville Disappearance", and the school was eventually shut down and vacated. **Everything** was removed from the compound, leaving behind an empty shell.
	
	
	"Wake up sleepyhead, we've arrived," said Harvey as he nudged me on my arm. I forced my eyes open and stumbled out of the car, letting out a big yawn while throwing my arms high up in the air for a good stretch.
	
	
	"C'mon you better start running! It's time for roll call!" bellowed the trainers.
	
	
	I sighed and dragged my lazy ass (as you can tell, not a morning person) to the assembly area located at the hall on level 2. After the grouchy trainers went through the usual mundane formalities (safety rules, emergency procedures, etc.), we were dismissed to do a ground sweep to ensure that there were no trespassers on the training grounds and to spot any potential safety hazard.
	
	
	My team was in-charge of the first level, and we split up to cover the entire area quicker. It wasn't our first time here, so it took me no time to complete my side of the sweep. As I exited the final classroom in the far corner of the west wing, something caught my eye - the metal gate at the stairs leading to the basement was ajar, with the old rusty padlock lying on the floor.
	
	
	Whenever we had training here, the trainers would emphasize one golden rule - never, ever, go down to the basement. Despite our persistent questionings, they had refused to tell us the reason. We eventually assumed they were simply afraid of mishaps because of the poor lighting down there. Knowing that filling up training injury reports isn't fun, we empathized with the trainers and complied with instructions.
	
	
	*I could have sworn that the padlock was on the gate when I passed it earlier.* Brushing it off, I walked up to close the gate and locked it with the padlock. That was when I heard it.
	
	
	Sobs and sniffles. To be exact, sobs and sniffles of a young boy, coming from the basement.
	
	
	"Hello kid? What are you doing down there? Do you need help?" I called out.
	
	
	No reply. Instead, the sounds grew fainter as if whoever made them was moving further away from me.
	
	
	"Hey! Come back! I'm here to help you!" I called out again.
	
	
	The sounds continued to fade until they completely disappeared.
	
	
	*Dammit*. At that moment, I had to make a decision: I could either return to call for backup, or rush down there before the boy went any further. I decided on the latter when I thought that the child was in distress and I couldn't afford to waste any time.
	
	
	*Wrong move. Just like the main character of every horror movie, stupid me was incapable of logical thoughts. Why the fuck would there be a young child in an abandoned middle school out in the middle of nowhere.*
	
	
	I rammed the padlock with the butt of my HK-MP5, the standard issue weapon of my unit. Thanks to its poor condition, the padlock gave way after three to four good hits. The gate swung open with a loud creak and I cautiously made my way down the stairs with the assistance of my trusty torchlight.
	
	
	The basement corridor was narrower than the other parts of the school, and the yellow-ish ceiling lights were slightly dimmer. Weirdly, there wasn't a single door along the corridor except for one at the very end. My inner-Sherlock deduced that the boy was inside that room, unless he could walk through the damned walls.
	
	
	I approached the door, reached for the knob, and slowly turned it - unlocked. I heaved a sigh of relief, knowing that he didn't lock himself inside. I gently pushed the door open and entered the room. That was when confusion hit me.
	
	
	It was empty.
	
	
	And I meant it literally. I was greeted by nothing but four blank walls and a ceiling light.
	
	
	"That's it," I thought to myself, "I'ma sleep early tonight."
	
	
	I turned around and made my way back to the first level, racking my brains to cook up a good reason why I busted the padlock. I assumed that "I imagined a boy's cries because of my lack of sleep" wasn't exactly a decent explanation.
	
	
	As I turned into the hallway of the first level, I froze.
	
	
	Firstly, there were lockers, benches, water dispensers, and everything else that weren't supposed to be there **anymore**. Secondly, it was pitch black outside the windows. If my memory served me right, it was fucking **0830 in the morning** when I had arrived here.
	
	
	I immediately knew something was wrong. *Terribly wrong*. There was no way I could have taken the wrong stairs up, because only a single flight of stairs connected the first level and basement.
	
	
	I was glued to the spot, mouth agape, trying to figure out what the heck was going on. When I finally got my senses back, I sprinted back to the entrance as fast as I could. As I dashed through the hallway, I caught a glimpse of the classrooms' interior - they were all filled with the typical classroom furniture, as if the school was never vacated to begin with.
	
	
	After what seemed like ages, I finally reached the main entrance of the school. And of course, the doors wouldn't budge. I stomp-kicked the hell out of them, but it felt like my legs would give way before the doors did. I peered out of the windows, trying to see the situation outside, and I was stared back by the darkness. *Pure darkness.*
	
	
	"What in the world..."
	
	
	I slumped against the doors in despair, unable to comprehend a single element of this situation. As I looked up at the split hallways leading to the east and west wings, I saw something else which wasn't present when I had first arrived at this god forsaken place - a banner hanging from the ceiling:

A true horror story

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpjdez/a_true_horror_story/


	Now, my story actually happened and I have proof. Links to news about the happenings at the end.
	
	2 days ago, a death happened at my school, which is highschool, primary and kindergarten. The person who died was a highschooler. Here's the story of how he died. He was a smart cool guy.
	
	So, around 2 days ago, on a normal weekend day, after all that stress, he was going to the park.
	With his headphones on his head. Nothing more, but, walking illegaly on the... train that goes through the city which I do not know the english name of's rails, a train.. hit him.
	
	But that's not the end. The friday before the day he died, one of his best friends told me about how he thought of suicide.
	
	Still not the end.
	
	After this, our bathrooms, one of them, had it written in blood his name. Me and my friend, Adam, saw that, and we did not want anyone else to know about this, so we cleaned it.
	
	The day after monday which I do not know the name of, some actual horror scenes happened.
	
	Some kid had been staring at us outside the windows for the whole day, which we got scared. His eyes were, almost yellow, his skin looked rotten, he has long, black hair. After our 3rd class, the kid started (another word I don't know which roughly means making flute sounds, not whispering but like making sounds like a flute does) in a calm, but depressing way. He went on like that for hours, until the next class.
	
	Do keep in mind, the kid was wearing a purple shirt, which highschoolers do.
	
	In the lunchbreak... Me and Adam went outside, to go to the place his friend told us.
	
	There was the kid. In blood.
	
	We ran away.
	
	Next day, nothing. No one remembered the situation.

My House is Haunted by the Future

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpjbhi/my_house_is_haunted_by_the_future/


	
	
	For the longest time, I’ve thought that my house is haunted. My parents and I moved into this place when I was eight years old, and the moment I stepped into the house, I felt like an unwanted guest. Recently though, I’m starting to wonder if maybe *I’m* the ghost. But we’ll get to that in a minute. For now, I want to explain what I know for sure: I’m seventeen years old, I was born on October 8th, 1998, and my name is Alex Krowski; my mother’s name is Alissa Blanchert, and my Dad’s name was David Krowski; I know that my dad died in 2009 from a drug overdose, and I know that it tore my mom apart.
	
	Now, I want to elaborate on what I said about thinking the house was haunted. There are quite a few reasons I believe this, one of which being the fact that both my mom and I have OCD, and need the toilet paper flap to be against the wall, but at least once a day the roll will be flipped. It’s a constant battle to keep the toilet paper correct. Maybe the exposure therapy will help our obsessiveness about the toilet paper, but we still both hate it. Nobody else lives with us since my dad died, so it’s not like somebody else in the house is pulling our legs for shits and giggles.
	
	Another reason I believe the house is haunted is because of the Boy. I just call him the Boy, I’ve never given him a proper name, but I see him often. The first time I saw him, we had only been moved in for two weeks, and Dad’s health was quickly deteriorating. The Boy had shoulder length brown hair, and glum green eyes. He never looked happy, or even just content. If I had to guess, I’d place him somewhere around 19 or 20. I had been setting up my train track to show my dad when he woke up, when I heard footsteps coming from behind me. I whipped around, expecting it to by my dad waking up early, but I didn’t see anyone. I turned my attention back to my train tracks to see that the track was put together, despite it just being in pieces. Since my dad was dying, my family was very spiritual, and I had been taught to thank ghosts if they do something for you. So, I thanked whoever had done it with a small “thank you’. After I thanked whoever had put my tracks together, the Boy appeared across from me. He had his legs crossed and arms back, supporting his body weight.
	
	“You’re welcome,” the Boy spoke.
	
	“Oh -” I wasn’t actually expecting to see a ghost, “what’s your name?” I asked innocently. I was scared, but I figured if you can’t let an animal know you’re scared, then you probably shouldn’t let a ghost know. Kid logic, y’know?
	
	“Wouldn’t you like to know,” the Boy smiled, sticking his tongue out, the sadness still showing in his eyes. Before I could open my mouth to ask more questions, he vanished. That was the first time he came around, but it was far from the last.
	
	I was curious about the history of our house, as we had been told it hadn’t been lived in since the 40’s. I wondered why nobody lived in it, but the realtor seemed reluctant to answer my questions when my parents were looking at the place. Over the course of two or so years, I learned that the last people to live in the house had gone insane. At the time, it was chalked up to God punishing them for their sins (it was rumoured they had been a gay couple), but the things the men said they experienced in the house were too consistent and detailed. I understand that people who experience delusions can have consistent beliefs, but I just believed what the men said, though I can’t explain why. Supposedly, the two had complained to friends that they weren’t alone in their house. One of them, Nick, claimed to see an eight year old boy crying in his bedroom - which I came to find out was *my* room. The other man, Jasper, said that he’d often see a dying man laying on a bed in their guest room. He claimed the man would turn a purpley shade, and gasp for breath, each inhale sounding like gargling. The dying man’s eyes would never leave Jasper whenever it happened. After watching my dad overdose, I knew what it looked like. Jasper described exactly what it looked like. When my dad was dying, his eyes were locked behind and above me, as if he were looking a man in the eyes. After my dad died, I would lock myself in my room and sob for what felt like hours. I was the same age as the boy Nick claimed to see in my bedroom. I think that my family are the ghosts that Jasper and Nick claimed to be tortured by.
	
	I think maybe it’s two timelines crashing into each other, or something of that effect. I think that Jasper and Nick got to see glimpses into my life fifty years before I was born. Jasper and Nick weren’t crazy, they were seeing the future. I wonder now if the Boy is a ghost of the future, and I wonder how much longer it is until he’s born. What about the house allows its occupants to see the future? Why do they appear to be ghosts, rather than physical people? I feel bad knowing my father and I may have driven two men insane, or at least made them scared enough to admit they were “seeing things”, while the Boy has done nothing truly remarkable enough to scare me. I can only hope they survived their time in the asylums and made it out unscathed, but considering the time it’s highly doubtful.
	
	For now, I’m going to try and talk to the Boy and ask him what year it is for him, and maybe get a name out of him. He only seems to come out when I’m trying to do something, kind of like an annoying older brother. I’ll just start on my project for school, and hopefully he’ll come out and we can talk. I’ll update when I manage to talk to him.
==================================================
My Neighbor's Attic

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpitcc/my_neighbors_attic/


	A couple of weeks ago I decided to get my life in order. I wanted to start living healthier, being more active, and not just lazily letting life pass me.
	
	My first step to this was that I started to clean. A lot. My house was a bit of a mess, and I've always heard the cleaner the house, the cleaner the soul. So I cleaned my house, and as I was cleaning I realized cleaning felt good. I felt cathartic. I liked it so much I didn't want to stop at just my house.
	
	I knew that my neighbor Ms. Fitzgerald, who lived across from me in our culdesac, was very elderly and maybe needed some help with cleaning. She had even asked me once last year if I could rake her front lawn. I never saw anyone come over to her house ever, so I figured a women her age, hey maybe she could use someone to clean up the place a bit, you know?
	
	So I went over and asked and she said she’d be happy if I cleaned her attic for her. The first thing I noticed about the attic was that it had a window that looked directly across the culdesac at my own bedroom window. I knew that window was there, having seen it from outside before, but looking at it from the inside, I never realized it gave a perfect view of my bedroom window, and my room inside…
	
	Everything was fine at first, I was listening to music on my phone while I cleaned. It felt good cleaning. Sweeping the floor. Arranging things. Throwing things out. I started to get that feeling again, like when I was cleaning my own house.
	
	The attic was pretty messy, it was obvious that Ms. Fitzgerald hadn’t been up there in years given her age; climbing the stairs wouldn’t be an option for her.
	
	Here’s where things went wrong. I was moving a box when I noticed something behind it.
	
	It was a doll.
	
	At first when I saw it, I almost gasped. The doll appeared to have the most life like eyes I had ever seen, but after blinking and looking again, they were just normal doll eyes.
	
	Must have been my imagination, right? Dolls can’t have human eyes. Still the doll, which was made to look like a boy in a blue suit with a red bow tie, freaked me out. I put it in the corner. I tried my best not to look at the doll, but even as I continued to clean I felt this presence staring at me. Burning a hole in the back of my head.
	
	But whenever I turned to look at the doll, it was the facing the corner, just like how I left it.
	
	Cleaning didn't feel so great anymore. I started to get a sick feeling, and knew I had to leave.
	
	I went downstairs, told Ms. Fitzgerald I was finished cleaning for the day and that I’d be back tomorrow. At first I wasn’t going to say anything, but then I asked her about the doll.
	
	“Oh, that old thing?” Ms. Fitzgerlad laughed. “That’s Bernard, such a lovely old thing, isn’t he?”
	
	“Uh, yeah, sure. Anyways, see you tomorrow.” I wanted to ask her more about, but at the same time I didn't, if you know what I mean. Something about the doll just felt wrong.
	
	“Oh yes, tomorrow, see you dear and remember, clean up, clean up, everybody cleannnn up!” She howled with laughter after singing this and the way she sang that song gave me the chills.
	
	I returned to Ms. Fitzgerald's house the next day. I figured maybe yesterday I just spooked myself. I wanted to get back to cleaning, to getting that sense of catharsis.
	
	I needed to right myself. It was just a dumb doll that belonged to a lonely old woman that needed a helping hand.
	
	But when I walked up to the attic my heart stopped. Bernard, the creepy doll, was sitting at the window sill, staring across the culdesac….looking right at my window.
	
	I knew that couldn’t be right. I definitely did not leave him by the window the day before. Maybe Ms. Fitzgerald put him there? No, no she’s way too old, she wouldn’t be able to make it up the steps.
	
	So how the hell did that doll get to the window sill….and why was it staring at my bedroom across the street?
	
	I found the courage to pick up the doll, and again for a split second I thought it had human yes, but then they were doll eyes gain. I put him back in the corner. And again as I cleaned I felt a hole burning in the back of my head.
	
	I finished cleaning the attic(a rushed job), and just like yesterday there was no satisfying feeling that came from cleaning. It had all had been tainted. I was too freaked out and decided that I wasn’t going to come to this house anymore.
	
	I went downstairs to tell Ms. Fitzgerald I was done cleaning. She was just sitting in her kitchen silently.
	
	“Ms. Fitzgerald,” I said. “I’m done. I’m going to go now.”
	
	“Oh, that’s nice dear. Thank you for cleaning my attic.”
	
	“S-sure, and hey Ms. Fitzgerald? Did you move that doll to the window sill? I swear I left it in the corner yester-“
	
	“I haven’t been up there in ages,” she said. “Poor Bernard, all alone up there. He probably just wants a friend.”
	
	“Yeah..right. Anyways I gotta go.”
	
	I got the hell out of there.
	
	That night I couldn't sleep at all. I checked my phone, and it said it was 3 AM. I kept resisting the urge to look out my window, but after a while I told myself there was nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all. Obviously Ms. Fitzgerald moved the doll and just forget….or maybe she was fucking with me. Right? Maybe she was just a mean spirited old woman, that wanted to fuck with the nice neighbor who offered to clean her attic. Sure. Yeah. That's it.
	
	There's no way that doll moved on it’s own.
	
	I got up and looked out my window. It was one of those nights where even though it was dark, there was enough moonlight that made world outside visible.
	
	I wish the moon had been covered by clouds that night. I wish it was pitch black and I couldn’t see a thing…
	
	Because when I looked out my window, I could clearly see Bernard the doll sitting in the attic window, staring right at me.
	
	Staring with those all too human eyes.
	
	I fell backwards onto my bedroom floor. “Not real," I said. Not real. He’s not there. He’s not there, hesnotthere…”
	
	But when I looked again he was there, and then the worse thing happened. I heard someone singing. It was the sound of a boy’s voice, and it was coming from Bernard. From that terrible attic. Even through the window, I could hear him clearly.
	
	His singing was pleasant, which somehow made it even worse.
	
	“Clean up, clean up, everybody clean up. Clean up, clean up, won’t you be my friend?”
	
	I shut my curtains and didn’t get any sleep that night.
	
	The next morning there was no doll in the attic window. I haven't gone to or spoken to Ms. Fitzgerald and haven't heard singing since that night.
	
	Nor have I looked at the attic window at night again. But I have the urge to. Every night I have the urge to look out at that attic window across the culdesac.
	
	
	And I just know when I do, I'll see those all too human eyes.

The Haunted House of 31st Street.

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpisdx/the_haunted_house_of_31st_street/


	Every year Mrs Baker holds the best party for our annual Sinister Celebrations Festival. For as long as the town could remember she had turned the halls of her old colonial into the spookiest haunted house in town. There were children’s skeletons and zombies roaming throughout. The haunted house of 31st street always seemed much more realistic than the one on main because Mrs Baker always hired very convincing actors to help her out. None of us ever knew anyone who had managed to get a job in Mrs Bakers haunted house, but it didn’t stop us from filling her letterbox with applications all year round. The only person who didn’t was this strange kid called Nick. He claimed his Uncle Wes had managed to get a job there when he was a kid and had never left. He said his mum wouldn’t let him apply because his uncle was never the same after working there. The rumour was that whatever candy was left got eaten by the workers, so it’s no surprise he was never the same. He probably had such a huge sugar rush that it re-wired his brain! If you managed to get through the haunted house there was more candy waiting on the back porch then you could ever need. Mars bars, crunchies, killer pythons, you name it, Mrs Baker had it all. Of course, I hadn’t seen it yet as last year Jeff and I had gotten scared in the basement. We had come across a particularly convincing kid zombie who had a gnarly scar on his right cheek. He had been thrashing about in his chains and we just had to get out of there. All year we had heard nothing from our friends but how good the back porch candy had been. We weren’t missing out on the candy again, even if we had to miss the haunted house. Last week Jeff and I scoped out the eastern fence of Mrs Bakers house which bordered an abandoned condo. And wouldn’t you know it, there was a perfect hole for us to sneak through to make sure we got a taste of this year's candy. With our buckets and costumes ready, we made for the gap and pushed our way through. As we emerged from the fence the holy grail was in sight. We couldn’t believe it had been so easy. Why had we ever bothered doing the haunted house? How had no one thought of this before? As we climbed the steps we were practically drooling looking at the tubs of kings size chocolate bars. Click. The stairs disappeared and we plummeted. When we came to Mrs Baker and he kid zombie with the scar from last year were waiting. ‘So Wes, do you think the thieves would rather be zombies or skeletons?’

The Little Girl that Lives in the Woods

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpirg0/the_little_girl_that_lives_in_the_woods/


	Ever summer since I was a little girl my dad had always taken us kids to the creek to swim. Not too far from the tree line in front of our house there was a creek that wound deep into the woods. Some parts were shallow and some were kind of deep. It took a little walking to get to the part of the creek that was deep enough to swim in but once we got there it was always worth it especially on a hot day.
	I'd been there by myself a time or two. Usually if we went without my dad it was me, my brother, and a few of his friends. I was the oldest but also the most frail. Medical problems starting from infancy had left my legs and feet weak and I was prone to losing my balance easily and falling. I was always the slowest getting to the swimming hole and my brother always had to hang back with me to help me walk over the giant rock and through the slippery slate that lined the creek.
	
	Here's a little back ground on my family.
	
	My brother and I had different mom's and he lived with his so there would be alot of times that he wouldn't be allowed to come visit. She was mean and abusive towards him and used his visits to see us as a  My dad and I lived alone in my grandma's house

The Experiments at Willow Ridge

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpiio4/the_experiments_at_willow_ridge/


	Title:  Why you've never heard of Willow Ridge
	
	
	Hello.
	
	
	My name is Paul. This name is fake, obviously, to protect my own identity. Don't want my name falling into the wrong hands.
	
	
	I'm the only survivor of the town of Willow Ridge, North Carolina.
	
	
	Never heard of it? Not surprised. It's a rather secluded, small town deep in the Appalachian mountains.
	
	
	And according to any and all records, the town no longer exists.
	
	
	The small town of Willow Ridge was home to about 500 residents.  Of course, the statistics always excluded the 3,000 personnel of the nearby military installment inside the limits, a new arrival about 7 months ago.
	
	
	I was one of the 500 townsfolk, owned a small restaurant chain with two locations: one right in the middle of town and another 3 miles away, by the interstate. Though I didn't directly work at the base itself, I frequently serviced some of my fine quality food to the base's higher-ups, who were too stingy for whatever bland cafeteria food they served there. On occasion, I even mass-catered to them a few times.
	
	
	While the work was near exhausting, especially when I had to make 3,000 meals, the paycheck, for my secrecy along with my food, more than made up for it. Me, and the other town residents who knew about the base, were all likely wealthier than anyone else in the mountains!
	
	
	Of course, it probably helped that we couldn't actually SPEND very much of our cash. We had to give the impression of a poor, rural mountain village to the few outsiders who strolled through our main street. Thus, we all had dilapidated homes, (at least on the outside) drove toyotas and ratty old pickups instead of luxury sport coupes, and spent little on clothing or luxury items. All we basically did with the money was save it up for college and a comfortable retirement, and a lavish vacation or two when the base higher-ups permitted it.
	
	
	I don't know what they did down in that base, all I know is that they wanted it secret. Badly. The hefty numbers on my nondisclosure paycheck proved it. And I was perfectly happy with that. I was content with my simple life, successful restaurant and loving, perfect wife and two daughters.
	
	
	Until she showed up at my door.
	
	
	It was late October, nearing midnight. I had finally arrived home through a fast-falling, sudden rush of snow after making and delivering a rather large military order and was reading a nice, entrancing novel on the sofa. The wife and kids were already fast asleep, snug in their warm beds. And when I was done with this chapter, I would join them.
	
	
	Suddenly, I heard a small thump from outside, in the backyard.
	
	
	"Huh?"
	
	
	Confused, I grabbed my shotgun and went to investigate. People shouldn't be out this late. There could be some kind of coyote out there, and that could mean trouble.
	
	
	When I opened the door, that's what I actually thought it was at first. A small, furry limp form lay on my concrete patio, barely breathing. It didn't look threatening. in fact, it looked exactly the opposite. I could tell it was badly hurt and exhausted.
	
	
	And it had a human body.
	
	
	At first, I was completely baffled. Was this some kind of mirage?
	
	
	I knelt down and picked the body up, then almost dropped it in horror.
	
	
	The head resembled a husky, with short, pointed ears, long muzzle, and black-and-white color pattern. It looked almost identical to the dog, save for the eyes, which were a bit too large and humanlike to belong to an actual husky.
	The doglike head was attached to a vaguely human body, ugly but efficient stitches criss-crossing the entirety of her neck. Its neck, along with the rest of the body, was sparsely coated with some kind of fur or thick hair, but not enough to hide the human body underneath, which judging by the "unique bodily features", resembled that of a teenaged girl.
	
	
	Her human body was horribly mutilated, with multiple stitched incisions and scars lacing her fragile frame. Her fingers were sewn together with medical precision, and then fused together by some kind of scarring, acidic chemical. The palms of her hands and the tips of her fingers were swollen hideously, along with the palms of her feet. A fluffy tail stuck out from her rear.
	
	
	And a nasty-looking shock collar was tightly fastened around her neck. The collar was damaged, but had stuck fast.
	
	
	I gasped in complete horror, almost dropping the girl onto the ground. I staggered, trying to regain my footing after the initial shock, luckily managing to swing inside and drop her onto the sofa. She was disturbingly easy to carry.
	
	
	Once she was safe, I looked over her mutilated body again, struggling to comprehend the horrors before me. Where did this . . . thing come from? What happened? How was this even possible?!?
	
	
	Just then, her eyes opened, revealing a rather lovely shade of bright-blue eyes.
	
	
	She weakly looked around, Her panic silently radiating throughout the entire room. She looked at me, her abject fear cutting right into my heart, then looked down at herself.
	
	
	As her eyes met her, she let out a small yelp of terror, running her disfigured hands over her body in pure terror. She tried forming words, but her canine muzzle wouldn't cooperate. All she could do was let out a few small, indistinguishable barks and yelps. After a minute, she gave up completely and broke down into sobs, crying into the couch.
	
	
	I was utterly dumbfounded by the whole situation. I had no idea what to do. What . . . who was she?  D-did she come from the . . . base?
	
	
	Nevertheless, I decided to make myself useful by getting her something to eat and drink. It looked like she hadn't had either for at least a week.
	
	
	After a bit of scrounging, I came up with a variety of food and a cup and a bowl of water. I placed her options in front of her, which was luckily enough to distract from her crying. Apparently, she really WAS hungry.
	
	
	She instantly went for the meat, tearing into it like only a canine could. I shuddered as I watched the last of the meat already disappear into her throat, then watched her approach the water, lapping up the bowl a few sips before eyeing the cup. She paused, staring at the bowl for a few seconds, then, a few tears forming in her eyes, reached for the cup and began trying to grab it with her deformed hands.
	
	
	I could tell she was confused and afraid. As the last of the water fell both into her mouth and onto the floor, I knealt down so i was facing her at eye level.
	
	
	"Hey," I said, doing my best to sound compassionate,"want to tell me about yourself?"
	
	
	"ARF!!!"  She barked loudly before suddenly cowering, looking ashamed at being unable to speak english. I tried giving her a paper and pen with slightly better results. Her deformed hands managed to etch out a (barely) comprehensible answer.

	My concern grew as I read her writing. Warehouse??? Was she talking about the old, "abandoned" warehouse that facilitated as the entrance to the army base? What's this about "experiments"? Human?!?!
	
	
	I plopped onto my armchair, lost in thought. Experiments? Kidnapping?
	
	
	I had an idea. I took out my phone and located the abandoned warehouse on google maps, and then showed it to her.
	
	
	"Is this where you were kept?" I asked, pointing to the image on my phone.
	
	
	She nodded yes.
	
	
	My anxiety grew heavily. The base . . . the government base . . . what were they doing down there?!? On people???
	My heart rose into my chest in horror. This . . . was happening right in our own backyard!
	
	
	I wanted to deny it. I wanted to say it was a lie, to ignore it and go on with my everyday life. But how could I? How could I ignore what was right in front of me?
	
	
	Another question rose as I watched her curiousity gradually override her fear, and she began walking around the living room.
	
	
	What now?
	
	
	Obviously, I didn't want to turn her in. She was in too poor shape. And judging by those scars and the collar, I don't think they'll be welcoming her with open arms.
	
	
	Speaking of the collar . . .
	
	
	Luckily, being born and raised in a small town for my entire life, I had some technical knowhow. If the collar was in perfect condition, It would have been a hassle, but luckily it was damaged enough I was able to break the electronic lock with my basic expertise without getting shocked.
	
	
	I had just gotten the collar off when I heard the roar of an engine coming from the front yard.
	
	
	Uh oh.
	
	
	Panic building, I swung open the window to see a military jeep screeching to a stop outside our house. A trail of humvees and a truck followed, pulling over onto the sides of the road. This can't be good.
	
	
	I thought fast. There was no way I was turning the girl back over. Who knows what they'd do?
	
	
	If I knew the answer to that, I would have stayed.
	
	
	Instead, I turned to the girl, now staring outside in terror, ears perked up with fright.
	"We need to go, now!"
	
	
	Grabbing the shotgun and collar, I pushed the girl outside and we both bolted into the woods, the town fading into the eerie darkness as I followed Molly through the forest.
	
	
	That was the last anyone saw of Willow Ridge.
	
	
	We ran through the woods for the rest of the night, determined to get as far away as possible. Of course, when you're trying to travel through a pitch-black forest with near-zero invisibility, "far away" isn't very far.
	
	
	In fact, by the time dawn began to burst through the darkened trees, we finally managed to stumble onto a road, exhausted and weak. With a small moan of horror, I realized it was the main road leading into Willow Ridge. In fact, I could see my restauraunt just down the road, with the highway right behind it! Then that small gasp turned into a shocked, horrified gasp as I gazed down the road and noticed two particular things.
	
	
	First was the long trail of smoke billowing from the direction of Willow Ridge.
	
	
	Second was the caravan of military vechiles making their way towards the stricken town from the highway.
	
	
	Me and Molly tried to scamper back into the forest, but this time it was too late: The first humvee screeched to a stop on the side of the road, out jumping 3 heavily armed soldiers. They turned to me with a confused glance, then their confusion turned into horror when they suddenly gazed upon Molly. They were left utterly speechless.
	
	
	And so was I.  I had no choice but to put my hands up. There was nothing I could do.
	
	
	To my suprise, however, the soldiers seemed to be acting as terrified as I felt, standing around hesitantly. Another humvee  pulled up and an official-looking officer strode out, eyes turning wide as saucers as they fell upon Molly.
	
	
	"Wha? . . ."  he stammered, taking a step back. He eyed one of the soldiers hesitantly before turning back to me. "Wh-what is this thing?"
	
	
	"You don't know?" I asked, confused. "I thought you worked at that base in Willow Ridge!"
	
	
	The officer's perplexed face grew even more.
	
	
	"What are you talking about? We have no military base in Willow Ridge."

Peeling

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpigyo/peeling/


	
	
	Can any of you help me? I’ve done some things recently that I wish I could take back. To start, I have OCD. Not the kind where my house has to be spotless. Or the kind where you have to do things a certain number of times. My disorder extends entirely to my appearance. I do anything and everything to make sure I look my best. I use the most expensive products I can afford.  Plus I follow a strict diet and exercise plan. All my hard work has paid off. For the most part. I get compliments from people pretty frequently.  And I don’t mean to brag, but I’ve been compared to models before.
	
	
	Although the compliments make me feel good, having to spend hours to keep up my appearance is exhausting. Recently I got sick of it. And I have been searching for ways to cure my disorder. I’ve read that it can’t be cured. But I had to at least try.  During my free time, which I rarely have, I browsed for solutions to my problem. All the websites I searched, yielded me no results. That is except for one. I noticed it in one of those promoted ad links.
	
	
	I don’t remember the exact address. But I do remember what it said. And that was,
	
	“ Are you looking for help to deal with your mental affliction? Check out our website to learn more.”
	
	
	It sounded generic as hell. But seeing as how none of the other websites got me my desired results, I decided to check it out. I was expecting another ad to pop up. One that was probably for some type of medicine. Or ten-step therapy plan that I’d probably end up paying thousands of dollars for. Instead I was met with bold text that said,” The Cure-All”.  The background it was on, showed multiple families playing. Like the ones, you see in medicine commercials. You know, the ones that look like they are having a wonderful time. While the narrator for the commercial quickly lists all the potentially hazardous side effects.
	
	
	Listed beneath the title in bullet points, were the names of various conditions in alphabetical order. Hovering over them with my cursor revealed hyperlinks to other pages. I scrolled down. Until I found mine. Clicking on it took me to a page that said
	
	” Cure your OCD with these easy steps!”
	
	I rolled my eyes at the page’s title. This was probably going to show me some pseudo-scientific cure. One where I’d have to drink a certain tea made from twelve different herbs. Or do some kind of weird exercise. Nonetheless, I scrolled down to see what sort of “ cure” it would give me, anyway.
	
	
	There was just one step. All it said were to find things to peel. This could be anything ranging from dried glue to stickers, to dead skin even. It instructed to start peeling if I ever feel my compulsions come on. Needless to say, I was skeptical that this could cure my condition. Still, it wasn’t something that was difficult to do. The only drawback I saw was feeling silly if it didn’t work.
	
	
	I happened to have a bottle of glue lying around. Which I grabbed. Then put four drops from it onto a plate. All I had to do now was wait for it to dry. I ended up forgetting about it until the following day.  It was early in the morning, a few hours before work. And I was trying to get my hair just right. Unfortunately, I ran out of the special gel I use. So, I had to go downstairs to see if I happened to have another bottle lying around.  That was when I noticed the plate.  The glue on it had dried completely. I remembered what the page had said.  And since my compulsion was seriously acting up then, I grabbed the plate. And began peeling off the pieces of dried glue.
	
	
	To my surprise, the feeling that had been burdening my mind for hours vanished. Words can not describe how freeing it felt. Like I had spent years in prison and was finally free. That website’s advice worked like a charm. Each time I felt a compulsion come on, I’d just peel a few strips of glue. And it would go away.  It worked great. Until a week ago.  I was having one of those days, where nothing went right. It rained, ruining my hair. Rude customers took up so much time with their complaints, the store fell behind schedule. And to top it all off, I tripped during my walk and scraped my knees. I admit that last one was my fault.  I should have stayed inside. But I had run in the rain before without having anything happen to me.  I picked myself up. Then muttered a few curse words to myself while heading home. I just wanted to put the entire day behind me. I didn’t even eat. I just showered, brushed my teeth, and headed straight to bed.
	
	
	Unfortunately, I had forgotten to squirt the glue drops onto a plate.  Something I would do each night. So that I could peel them the following morning to soothe my compulsions. I scolded myself for letting it slip my mind. And that morning my OCD was particularly bad. Probably brought on by the stress of the previous day. I began looking for something else I could peel. The only thing other peelable things I had was bananas.  As you can guess, peeling them didn’t help. Plus, I wasted some perfectly good food.
	
	
	I began to think that I would just have to deal with my usual urges. Then I got an idea. I peeled away the band-aids I used to cover my knee scrapes. Peeling away the band-aids soothed me some. But what I did next, put me in pure ecstasy. I sat on one of my kitchen chairs. And began picking at my scabs. The satisfaction I got from peeling them away was addicting. Problem was, I wouldn’t always have scabs to peel away. Or would I?
	
	
	My eyes fell on my kitchen knives. I used one of them to make several deep cuts along my leg. When I was finished I tended to my cuts with some hydrogen peroxide. Then covered them in band-aids. If you think I ended up developing some sort of masochistic cutting habit, you’d be half right. I did develop a habit of cutting myself. But the cutting itself is not what I drew pleasure from. The scab peeling is.  This habit started small. But soon I made cuts all over my body. Just to peel them when they healed.
	
	
	However, I ended up going another step farther.  I got back from the hospital last night. I was put in there for a large wound to my leg. And blood loss.  This happened due to incredible stupidity on my part. In addition to the stupidity I had that made me start this habit in the first place. I got yet another one of my ideas. And that was...What if I tried peeling away some of my own skin?
	
	
	I tried this in my bathtub. I sat there with my sharpest knife. I had to mentally prepare myself for what I was about to do. I started on the outside of my leg. I figured that peeling off a little skin wouldn’t be too serious. I pressed the point of the knife into my leg. Then dragged down. I’m sure I don’t need to tell you how painful it was. I nearly passed out from the pain. But I was able to push through. I ended up peeling off a sizeable chunk of my leg’s skin. It was so painful yet so pleasurable.
	
	
	So, I cut away more. And more. And more.
	
	
	Soon, my leg was covered in red. I was losing a lot more blood than I thought. That was when I realized I cut too deep. I accidentally hit an artery, making blood squirt out of my leg. Instantly panic flooded my mind. Fortunately, I was able to calm myself down. The reason being I had prepared for this. I made sure to have a first aid kit on stand by. Just in case something went wrong.  I was able to stop the bleeding. Then call an ambulance.  Of course, they asked me how I got my injuries in the first place. And since I couldn’t think of any believable lies, I told them the truth. They immediately scheduled me for a psychological evaluation. It’s tomorrow.
	
	
	I’m sitting here in the hospital, typing this on my phone. Thankfully, I remembered it. And asked one of the paramedics to grab it and my charger. I’m terrified they’ll have me committed. I’ve heard stories of those places. Of the abuse, patients are put through. I do not want to end up there.
	
	
	I realize now that the website didn’t cure me. It just made me switch from one habit to another. So, to reiterate, can any of you help me? I need to figure out a way to convince them I’m not crazy. Then again, I’ve had the urge to peel for a while now. The hospital won’t let me near any sharp objects...Maybe I do need help.  I just don’t want it from people who abuse their patients. So, what should I do?
==================================================
My sister disappeared on her way to cosmetology school

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpide4/my_sister_disappeared_on_her_way_to_cosmetology/


	Jasmine always wanted to be a hairdresser. Growing up, she was always giving her dolls colorful new hairstyles with coloring pens. I wasn't too impressed to find my action men with glued on mohawks, though. Nobody else in our family has been a hairdresser, so I don't know where she got the inspiration from at such a young age, but there was nothing else she seemed to want to do. She graduated high school with great grades, so she could have done anything, but nevertheless, she enrolled at the nearby cosmetology school a few weeks later. She really seemed to be enjoying it, but after a few months she vanished. Our small-town police department couldn't find any evidence of foul play and since she was an adult, they didn't put much effort into finding her. She's been gone for nearly ten years now.
	
	Sometimes I look for Jas online. Her socials haven't been updated since she disappeared, but today when I was looking at websites on one of those internet archival websites, I had the idea to see if anything she used to have got deleted. I don't know why I'd never thought to do this before, but I got lucky and found posts from an online journal she used to keep:
	
	---
	
	**05/31/10**
	
	Dear Diary,
	
	I’m so excited! Tomorrow I get to start training for my dream career. I can’t believe I’m going to be a hairdresser. My friends laughed at me when I told them I was going to beauty school, but what do they know? When they’re slaving away behind a computer screen or cleaning toilets, I’m going to be creating beautiful hair and having so much fun! School starts early, so I better get some sleep! xxx
	
	---
	
	**06/01/10**
	
	Today was so fun! All my classmates are so nice. We got our kit and learned the basics of what everything is for. It feels so weird to hold scissors like a hairdresser, but I’ll get used to it. We went over the school’s rules, and wow, there are a lot of them. It’s going to be hard to remember them all...some are kinda weird, like how we have to give our practise mannequin heads back to the teacher for storage when we go to lunch. We're not allowed in the storage room for some reason.
	
	I thought we’d have to use our own mannequins like the ones you can buy in the store, but the school provides them. Oh well, I guess that saves me money. Apparently the hair even grows...I don't know how that works...maybe the teachers put new hair on them after class? xx
	
	---
	
	**06/10/10**
	
	We started learning about hair color today. My teacher told us that since we use the school's mannequins, the color will work exactly like it does on a human because the store mannequins have a mix of human and fake hair. The school's mannequins even feel warm on the scalp, so we really have to make sure we don't put the bleach on the roots first, or it'll end up really bright there. She said that the store mannequins get the human hair from places in Asia where people are told they’re donating their hair to a god…how cruel is that?! xox
	
	---
	
	**06/11/10**
	
	We practised up-dos today. I'm not really very good at them, but I can kind of do a cute braid. I did it on Ms. Doris (all the mannequins have funny names like that). When I got back from lunch, someone had taken the braid down. I don't know who could have done it since she was locked away with the rest of them. I could have sworn the expression on Ms. Doris' face changed slightly when I got angry. Someone tutted, but that must have been my teacher...she is pretty strict. xx
	
	---
	
	**08/18/10**
	
	Sorry I haven't written in so long! I've been busy with school. Today was a bit weird... I left my mannequin on my station when I went to lunch, and I know that's against the rules, but I don't see why the teachers had to get so angry. :'( When we got back from lunch, we weren't allowed to go back in for the rest of the day and had to go home. I'll lose some points on my grade, which sucks, but it was fun to have half the day off. :)
	
	---
	
	**08/19/10**
	
	Today was so weird. The mannequin I used yesterday isn't there anymore. I was halfway through a color on it, so now I'll have to start all over again. ): It was going to be a really cute blonde and pink color. It took me forever to bleach the black out of it! If a mannequin could look sleepy, Ms. Barbara did! LOL xox
	
	---
	
	**08/29/10**
	
	It's almost Halloween! I'm going to Brad's house for a party…he’s gonna make a cute zombie. ;) his parents are out of town, so he has an empty house. I've got my costume all planned out and I'm going to go as a vampire.
	
	I think the our teachers tried to play a Halloween prank on us today. I accidentally cut my mannequin's ear when I was doing a haircut on it. It started BLEEDING! It was so cool and realistic! My teacher quickly took the mannequin away...I guess they had to patch him up...LOL!
	
	When I was heading to the restroom, I see my teacher had left the storage room door open...I couldn't resist taking a peek. My mannequin was in there and my teacher was spraying a blue gas on it. I thought Barbicide only came as a liquid...weird. xx
	
	---
	
	**09/04/10**
	
	Ahhh, tomorrow is going to be so fun! I CAN'T WAIT! Mr. Cartwright (he owns the school) told me a charity that makes wigs is coming in and taking hair donations. I'm going to donate my ponytail. It’s toooooo long and it's about time I had a more stylish haircut. I think I might get a cute bob. I might even dye it red! It's a bit weird they're doing it on a Sunday, but I guess they don't want to mess with our schedules? I’m going to love walking in on Tuesday with a cool new cut and color! xoxoxo
	
	---
	
	That was the last entry. She never arrived home that day. The police interviewed the teachers at the school, but they all said no donation event was ever planned and had proof they weren't even at the school. The security cameras from businesses near the school showed her walking in that direction, but the school didn't have security cameras, so there was no proof she was there that day.
	
	I'm back in town for a few days to see my parents. I'm overdue for a haircut, so maybe I'll see why Jas loved that school so much.
==================================================
Miss Maggie

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpibge/miss_maggie/


	I once had this weird teacher in grade 7. Her name was Miss Maggie and she was my science teacher. At first I thought she was cool, we experimented a lot with chemicals and we learned a lot about the human anatomy. But she got kind of weird cause she would only teach us only those two subjects. I just rolled with it thinking that it’s just gonna be easier for us, plus we get to have more fun playing with chemicals and stuff.
	
	Then one day, I noticed that she’s been getting close to this one foreign exchange student, Javier. He seemed kind of weirded out by it but didn’t seem to mind all that much. One day he didn’t show up to class and at first I didn’t think anything of it, the next day the same thing happened. It was like for for a few days where I started to notice that something seemed wrong.  I just thought that maybe he moved back to his country or moved to a different state.
	
	Miss Maggie then turned her attention on me and, in a way, tried seducing me. As a kid going through strong hormones, I kind of liked it. Now before you ask, nothing sexual happened, however she wasn’t the best looking teacher and did her best to seduce me. After finishing up a test one day, I placed my test on her desk where she then grabbed my hand. I looked back at her and she just stared at me with a chilling smile. She said to me, “I hope you have a great day Joshua.” I wasn’t sure what to say so I just said thanks and went on my way. That night my parents were out and I was tasked to watch my sister and not go out.
	
	I must’ve watched 3-4 Disney movies nonstop with my sister before I took her to bed. I played some games for a bit before I went to bed. I was getting ready to go to bed when I hear a knock coming from the main door. I didn’t answer it, as it was already 12 am and I was pretty tired, however there was another knock. I make my way to the door and open it to find Miss Maggie.
	
	“Joshua, I need to speak to you about your marks.” She said with an eerily smile.
	
	“Umm Miss Maggie, it’s 12 am on a Friday night. Couldn’t this wait until Monday?” I asked.
	
	She just stood there smiling at me. I notice that she’s holding something behind her back and slowly start to close the door.
	
	“Are your parents home? Perhaps I can have a word with them?” She said as she was trying to force her way in.
	
	“No. Now can you please go away.” I basically ask nicely, trying not to find out what she has behind her.
	
	I notice that whatever she has, she’s gripping tighter and tighter on it, so I close the door and lock it just before I hear her screaming and clawing at the door. I rush to the phone, but as I go to call my parents, the phone line is dead. Miss Maggie must’ve cut the line. Then suddenly the power went out. From the corner of my eye I see the face of Miss Maggie appearing from the corner of a window, and in her hand, a knife. She scratches the window with an eerie smile and looks at me.
	
	“Come out Joshua, I want you all to myself.” She said looking directly at me.
	
	“Please just leave me alone!” I say basically in tears and fearing for my life.
	
	I go into the kitchen and quickly grab a knife, I then run upstairs to my sister’s room where I wake her up and tell her that we needed to hide in the closet. We stay in the closet for a bit and I think that it’s safe, however as I go to open the closet, I hear creaking coming from the hallway. My sister let’s out a whimper, to which I quickly covered her mouth. I gestured to her that she needed to keep quiet. I then hear doors opening coming from the hallway. Then I hear my sister’s room door open and suddenly, it’s her, Miss Maggie.
	
	“Come out, come out, where ever you are. I promise I’ll keep you safe.” She said while slowly walking around the room.
	
	I grip my knife, ready to attack if she opens the closet door. She makes her way to the closet door and places her hand on the knob, when all of a sudden, my dad comes home and aims his pistol at her. She goes to the ground and my dad calls the police on his wireless phone.
	
	Miss Maggie was arrested that night and charged with attempted murder, breaking and entering, and first degree murder. Turns out that when the police investigated Miss Maggie’s home, they found the body of Javier with multiple stab wounds. Needless to say, I’m just glad to be alive and well after all these years.
==================================================
Me and my friends found an occult ritual, but I saw something much scary.

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpib63/me_and_my_friends_found_an_occult_ritual_but_i/


	
	Melissa had called me late at night. She was rambling on about this place she had heard about, an abandoned factory in the middle of the woods. Where I’m from places like this aren’t uncommon due to it being a relatively small town surrounded by thick forest.
	
	After about ten minutes of listening to what felt like her endless rambling, I chimed in. “So are we going or not?” the question seemed so simple in my mind. I could practically feel Melissa smirk on the other side of the line.
	
	“I’ll be at your house in ten with some of the guys” she replied smugly before hanging up. I promptly unraveled myself from the cocoon of blankets I had created around me and rolled out of bed. Pulling a black hoodie over my head. My phone quietly chimed as a notification popped up on my screen.
	
	The text was from Melissa.
	
	We’re here, get ur an** outside
	
	
	I quietly slid my window open before roughly landing in the bushes below. A dull huff escaped me as I struggled to escape the trap known as a bush. A handful of snickers echoed from the van.
	
	“Oh shut up” I grumbled as I finally managed to make my way to Michael’s trashy stoner van. The back window was blown out and the stale smell of weed lingered in the air.
	
	“You and that bush seem to know each other pretty well huh” Austin teased with a light chuckle. I rolled my eyes with a snicker. Austin was the definition of a golden boy. Well to most people at least. He was smart, athletic, good looking. Most girls practically fell at his feet, but like I said most. I knew Austin to well to be one of those girls, knew all his in's and out's, ups and downs. Everything
	
	
	
	A song lightly lulled through the car as we drove down the bumpy dirt road, Michael was gently humming along. Michael had always been chill, it was just his vibe I guess. Melissa and our other friend Heath were now playing a heated game of slapjack as Austin and I did our own things. My finger dragged along the cold and foggy window creating shapes. I couldn't help but smile back at the smiley face I had just created.
	
	̈ ̈What should I name him?¨ I pondered to Austin while briefly pointing to the doodle. He seemed to think for a moment before answering.
	
	̈ ̈Alejandro?¨ he didn't sound too confident. He scratched the back of his neck as he indecisively answered. I smiled slightly.
	
	̈Yeah that ́ll work ̈
	
	
	̈ ̈Guys we're here¨ Michael announced as the van slowly rolled to a stop. I looked out the fogged-up window trying my best to make out the dark shapes outside. A light sigh escaped my lips as I wiped the window clean of Fogg. RIP Alejandro, I guess. The building had an overwhelming amount of graffiti scattered across its walls along with a handful of shattered and cracked windows. Creepy.
	
	Melissa was the first to step out of the car, I followed. The dirt and rocks beneath my feet lightly crunched under my weight as I walked a bit closer to the building.
	
	̈Flashlight?̈ I said looking towards the guys. Heath let out a sigh as he hesitantly handed me one of his. ̈Thanks Heath ̈ I said, my words practically dripping with honey.
	
	̈ ̈Yeah Yeah whatever, just don ́t drop this one ̈ He said with a small grown.
	
	̈ ̈Sure thing ̈
	
	
	A small hum played on my vocal cords as I followed closely behind Melissa. The guys bickered with one another behind us as they followed. A small giggle escaped me as I listened to Heath insult Michaels van.
	
	̈ ̈Hey don ́t bring her into this ̈ Michael said appalled that someone would insult his prized van like that.
	
	̈Will you three stop ̈ Melissa groaned as she pushed the door to the old factory open. It let out a loud squeal as it swung open. Everyone stopped for a moment as we all inspected the insides.
	
	̈Well let's go I guess ̈ I said with a shrug as I walked in.
	
	
	The first floor was decently empty, just a couple of offices with old desks and chairs. Not to mention the overwhelming amount of paperwork that littered the floor. Pretty lame for an abandoned factory if you ask me, but the second floor was much more interesting.
	
	I watched as Austin practically threw himself at a rusted metal door, the door reluctantly busted open after a couple tries causing swirls of dust and dirt to dance in the air.
	̈ ̈Nice job Austin ̈ I said lightly patting him on the shoulder.
	
	¨I know ̈ he arrogantly said. I take back my compliment.
	
	
	The room was full of old factory equipment and rusted pipes, it was like a maze. I ducked under a rusty piece of metal weaving my way deeper into the labyrinth.
	
	“This place is dope” I exclaimed snapping a couple pictures with my phone. I got a couple of hums in response.
	
	“Hey, guys!” Heath called out “look at this”. I made my way over to the tallboy. He was pointing his flashlight at a messily painted pentagram on the ground. I knelt down silently beside him snapping a quick photo.
	
	“Weird” I mumbled to myself. We had found pentacles and other occult stuff before but this one seemed so much more present for some reason.
	
	
	“It’s just some satanist sh**,” Melissa said with a shrug.
	
	“Maybe there are some ghosts roaming around” Mike joked.
	
	“Hardy har har, very funny” I sarcastically said with a huff. He chuckled lightly.
	
	
	
	“Umm guys” Heath shouted out, I looked over at him. A bloodied rabbit hung off a metal pipe. Its white fur was stained a muddy red. I sucked in a harsh breath, I was not expecting that. The air in the room seemed to thicken around us, I could tell we were all feeling the same thing. Fear.
	
	“I’m sure it was just some kids screwing around,” Melissa said forcing a short snicker. I short her an odd look, she was trying to calm the nerves in the room. I let out a low huff and walked up next to her.
	
	“Yeah I’m sure it was just some middle schoolers fucking around and being edgy or some shit” I stated siding with Missy. The guys were silent for a minute, letting our words set in for a minute. The abandoned factory was dead silent, the only sound being the gentle whisper of a summer breeze. I swallowed debating what to say next “guys lets just go, we can do get food or something” I shrugged anxiously, I had been getting a weird vibe all night at this point.
	"Yeah let's go" Heath said starting towards the door. One by one we all followed.
	The car was silent, not even the radio was playing. As Mike focused on the road and everyone else doing only God knows what; I quietly looked outside eager to get the fuck out of here. That's when I saw it. A boney pale creature with long slim limbs and dull milky white eyes was standing not even 5 feet from the car. It's bloody mouth was twisted in a horrific grin as it made eye contact with me.
	I flew back from the window, slamming my head against the emergency brake. The car erupted with concerned questions.
	"Oh my God Griff, are you okay?" Missy asked as I sat back up. A nice migraine had bloomed in the back of my cranium. Ouch.
	"Yeah" I answered shakily "just get me the fuck out of here".
	
	The thing was gone, but my friends still don't know what I saw. Do I tell them? Do I go look for it? I'm so lost and frankly scared out of my mind now.

Bloodless Vivisection

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpiazj/bloodless_vivisection/


	The vanishing started slowly. One morning Julie and I woke up to find her left pinky missing. No blood, no sign of any injury, merely absence. Of course, we rushed straight to the doctor but he proved just as puzzled as we were.
	
	“No sign of contusion or laceration. It’s just *gone*,” he informed us unhelpfully.
	
	After a battery of tests found nothing else amiss we were released back to our lives, which we both continued as normally as possible. That is, until the next morning.
	
	It was a toe this time.
	
	Then the panic really set in. We ran back to the emergency room, demanding more than the brush-off we had gotten the day before. To no avail. They decided to hold her for observation. I stayed by her side as she fell asleep and long into the night until I too surrendered to the abyss.
	
	Another finger.
	
	The various instruments they had plastered upon Julie gave no better explanation than had the doctor. All they could say for certain was that at 2:14 AM her right ring finger had been attached to her hand and at 2:15 AM it was not.
	
	Understandably, Julie was distraught. I held her as she wept, whispering soothing platitudes in her ear which I myself disbelieved.
	
	Whatever power confronted us now was clearly beyond the pale of medical science. And so, against all the doctors’ advice, we rushed off to healers, mystics and religious leaders, desperate for the explanation science had failed to give.
	
	“This herb will ward off evil spirits” a voodoo priestess informed us.
	
	“Speak these words and draw a chalk circle around your bed at night,” an occultist suggested.
	
	None of it forestalled the inevitable. Every morning at 2:15 AM another appendage vanished from Julie’s body. Fingers and toes were just the beginning, however.
	
	Soon, more vital body parts were drawn into this terrible void. Muscles, tendons and nerves according to the MRI results. Julie was confined to a wheelchair. The general atmosphere of our house settled into a familiar, gray oppression which threatened to suffocate all of its occupants. The Sword of Damocles hung over us, day by day.
	
	Julie’s work as an attorney continued, but she could no longer appear at trial. She no longer possessed the strength or conviction. She took to setting an alarm for 2:15 AM, waking and thoroughly examining her body for its latest betrayal. But, soon, the malevolent force which had gripped her gave rise to more sinister losses. In conversation I brought up old friends and events from the distant past which she could no longer remember. It became clear, then, that on those nights when no physical deprivation was apparent her mind was being slowly stolen.
	
	One night, as we both sat in a grim diner, with the flickering neon sign standing austerely above us and the exhausted waitress shuffling from one table to the next as in a dream, she told me,
	
	“If it gets too bad… I want you to end it, Jim. I don’t want to end up like my father.”
	
	We had both seen her father’s long, excruciating slide into dementia, depression and death. Such an occurrence would weigh on any soul.
	
	“I don’t know if I can do it,” I whispered, looking up at the broken “e” in the sign.
	
	“You have to,” she insisted, and took my hand, drawing my gaze back.
	
	And, in those pleading eyes I saw a sincerity I could not refuse. I nodded, and sealed our fates.
	
	“If the day comes that I don’t remember you, you’ll know it’s time.”
	
	And that night, as I pushed her wheelchair back to the apartment in perfect silence, our hands clasped each other as if clinging to life itself. We squeezed and squeezed until it seemed our hands were becoming one with the pressure, and I wish that they had. Gladly, I would have shared her fate, for mine, in surviving her, was far worse.
	
	\*\*\*
	
	That day came a week later. Julie, now bedridden, woke and screamed upon seeing me sharing her bed. After the initial shock, and my careful explanation, I helped her into the wheelchair and changed her bedpan.
	
	But, I could not bring myself to murder the woman I loved. Not while there was something left of her to destroy.
	
	I carried on as best I could, making sure Julie was as comfortable as possible. But, soon, she could no longer even leave her bed to sit in the wheelchair. And, some days after that, one of her lungs disappeared and her breathing grew incredibly labored.
	
	It was about that time that I engaged the services of hospice care. Not too long afterwards, one of the nurses from the agency slipped me a vial of morphine and whispered in no uncertain terms that its dosage was lethal.
	
	“For when the time comes,” she told me. “Only you can know when that is.”
	
	She did not know the nature of Julie’s condition but in truth neither did I.
	
	I knew when it was time. One day, I looked down at Julie and saw the shell of the woman I had once known. Our eyes locked once more and in their pleading depths I saw that same sincerity she had shared with me all those months ago.
	
	My error in ignoring her wishes could be continued no longer.
	
	“I’m sorry, my love,” I whispered into her ear, my tears falling onto her already nearly lifeless face as I depressed the plunger into her IV line.
	
	And, as her eyes closed in peace and serenity for the final sleep, I cursed the nameless fate which had stolen the woman I loved from me, a piece at a time. And, still more, I cursed its cruel mockery in utilizing me as the final hammer blow of its depravity.
==================================================
Haunted buildings always had the best scrap metal.

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dpi7wr/haunted_buildings_always_had_the_best_scrap_metal/


	I went to high school in the mid-nineties near Ogden Utah. My junior year, I earned extra money salvaging scrap metal from condemned buildings. Some of them weren’t empty.
	
	I haven’t thought about those nights in a long time, to be honest. Not until this morning.Out of nowhere, Lyndsey Fallon messaged me. Lyndsey of all people. I haven’t seen her in twenty years.
	
	And so here I am. I can’t sleep and I need to get some of this down on paper. About the things we saw. About the trouble we ran in to with BECA and the Mormon Church because of it all.
	
	I guess it was always about Lyndsey. Her and what she found in the mall that night. The night I met her was the night I saw my first ghost.
	
	Back then there just weren’t any jobs for kids my age in town and Dad needed help with money. I applied ten times over at every drive-through and grocery store in the county before I started scrapping.
	
	It was sort of the only option.
	
	Before I go much further, I need to give a big disclaimer: you should never ever go exploring a condemned structure. Not ever. But especially in Ogden. Things have gotten better but I think something is still very wrong there.
	
	Not to mention it isn’t safe in the traditional sense.
	
	Scrapping was without a doubt the stupidest can’t-believe-I-didn’t-die-in-a-hole thing I have ever done. You should never never ever ever do what I’m about to describe.
	
	So with that out of the way …
	
	It was Megan Rollins who brought me into it. We were at lunch one day just talking and pushing our food around and I’d been wearing the same shirt for two days.
	
	She said, “Jen, it’s like two hours work and you get fifty goddamn bucks. You can’t even find a job.”
	
	And she was right. After all that blight started to spread, Ogden refugees were flooding Layton and Roy and there just wasn’t enough hiring going on and my dad already worked three gigs part time for peanuts.
	
	So I thought, why not?
	
	Megan was friends with Adam Wallace, and apparently Adam had an uncle who had some connection who knew how to sell scrap metal and refurbished machinery.
	
	Friend of a friend of a friend of a friend.
	
	We would be salvaging copper pipes, or steel, or sheet metal, or whatever. All over town.
	
	I say “salvaging” but let me be clear: these buildings were one-hundred percent off limits. Condemned by BECA. We were not authorized by the city in any way to enter or remove anything from the premises.
	
	Yes, I get it. I get that, on top of this being ridiculously dangerous, we were doing something ridiculously illegal . And no, I didn’t think it was that big of a deal because it was somebody else’s idea after all.
	
	Still, I remember how scared I was the first time I went out with Megan and Adam and their crew.
	
	That first run was to Ogden City Mall. Good god. That place.
	
	The whole ride, Jake Wangscott sat in the bed of Adam’s truck with me and Ray and Megan telling ghost stories about the mall.
	
	I knew Odgen City Mall like the back of my hand. It had shut down a few years ago, but back when I was a kid, my brother had two obsessions. Just two.
	
	One of them was Tim Burton’s Batman. The other was the Goldmine.
	
	I can’t count the times Sean begged Mom for pocket change so we could take the bus downtown to the mall just so that he could stare — and I mean stare — at the Batman merch.
	
	Not buy anything. Just stare at it.
	
	If Sean ever had a genie he would have wished for I swear to god nothing more than that heavy rubber cowl hanging in Hamblin’s for $150.
	
	He would have killed for it. Killed anyone.
	
	And the Goldmine arcade was where we always went after he was tired of staring, so that he could spend the rest of mom’s pocket change playing Golden Axe or Rastan
	
	I never got to play.
	
	If he could have left me home and used my bus fare to play another round, he would have. But Mom always made him take me with him and so I stood there and watched in the pulsing light from all the cabinets. A kid sister in all that noise and gorgeous sad dreaming of his.
	
	I remember sitting at the Pac-Man table in the back. I had a barrette in my hair and I had chipped nail polish.
	
	Flash forward, tougher than the polish, there I was riding in Adam’s truck, and Jake was trying to tease me like the place was haunted. Trying to tell me the Goldmine was “one of the bad places” because there was “something dead waiting in there.”
	
	He smiled. He tried to unroll my jean cuffs.
	
	Jake was a skinny git and sad.
	
	We heard a lot of talk like that about Ogden back then and Jake knew it. He said he had a friend who pried up the roll gate on the Goldmine and went in to check for coins in the token machine.  Which is where they would have been.
	
	Jake laughed and tried to hook his finger under my bra and said he swore it was true. This friend of his went in and saw something toward the back. Jake’s friend swore something crawled out from under the air hockey table just at the edge of his flashlight, and that was all it took.
	
	He dropped back under the gate and crawled — crawled! — away. He left his car jack under roller and never went back for it, said Jake.
	
	I don’t know if it was true, and Jake fully refused to name this friend of his.
	
	Megan wasn’t too happy with how handsy he was being so he stopped.
	
	When we reached the mall it was late and we had to go around to the back of the building where the loading docks were. The whole place was fenced and parts of it were flood-lit, but Adam’s pals had been here the night before and cut a hole in the chain link where the lot was dark.
	
	There were three trucks with us that night and they all backed to the docks.
	
	From what Adam said, it would be a quick job. We were going to dismantle two escalator drives and some of the tension gears and call it a night.
	
	In and back out.
	
	We had all the tools we would need, including wrenches and an engine lift.
	
	In and please god right back out.
	
	And it was quick work. A few guys set up lights, the rest of us took pieces as they were disassembled and walked or rolled them out to the trucks.
	
	There really wasn’t much to it.
	
	But looking back, it was damn strange. I wasn’t the only first-timer there. Ray and Beth for instance. And it was like, there was more going on than regular crew was telling us. They just wanted us to do our jobs and not ask questions.
	
	Like, some of Adams friends went to other parts of the mall and stood around almost like lookouts. Except they weren’t watching the doors or entrances or anything to warn us about security guards or the cops.
	
	Instead, they were posted at random shopfronts. Restrooms. The elevator. Storage. Places where no cop or security guard would ever be.
	
	The only person really watching the entrances at all was Megan, who rolled around the whole time on her rollerblades.
	
	The rest of us were told to just stay on task. Go from the escalators to the docks and do not wander off. Ever.
	
	Adam was very specific about this.
	
	And I would have totally followed the rules that night if it hadn’t been for Lyndsey Fallon.
	
	We were almost done with the escalators. Adam was talking about how his uncle’s pal had a buyer for another buyer somewhere in South America and the whole salvage was worth ten grand or something outrageous.
	
	Not sure if that was all legit, but I knew I was getting paid.
	
	We had just a few things left to gather, when here comes Lyndsey, walking up the ramp at the loading dock wearing gloves and boots and tiny as hell because she was only ever 5 foot 1.
	
	Adam saw her and tried to stop her from going inside. He said something to the effect of, “You’re not in on this Lynds. Whatever you think you’re doing here, my crew is Audi and you’re on your own.”
	
	But Lyndsey kept walking. She had her own gear: a backpack and some rope, and who knew what else.
	
	I was still going back and forth carrying tools and odds and ends to the trucks and I saw her pass the crew, into a service hall. This was one of the places Adam’s people had been “guarding” but they’d packed up too and Lyndsey followed her flashlight into that narrow hall.
	
	At the time, I had no idea what she was up to. I thought, maybe she wanted to skim some of the security equipment to refurb and sell, but probably that wasn’t it at all. I knew she had some strange obsession with these buildings and was trying to figure it all out. My brother Sean said Lyndsey had been attacked by something in a shuttered office near the river, one time. Her and another girl. It had been bad.
	
	Anyway, rumor had it she wasn’t there to loot the place or find scrap or anything. She was looking for information. Whatever that meant.
	
	That night, I followed her. I wasn’t very smart.
	
	Lyndsey didn’t even know I was behind her because my flashlight was off and I was watching her beam. But at one point she went around a corner and things got dark for me and I tripped in the hall.
	
	I didn’t know where I was. Probably the offices for whoever owned the mall and whatnot.
	
	As soon as I’d lost Lyndsey I turned on my own flashlight and took a look around and had a serious jump scare.
	
	The walls were covered with writing. Thick black magic marker all over the paint. It looked like scripture verse but I didn’t read any of it. Here and there were shapes, squares and diamonds, and in the middle of it all a face with long hair and shut eyes.
	
	I remember that part because it made my skin crawl. Every shadow was a hand reaching for my wrist. All of a sudden I was completely paranoid.
	
	I went around the same corner Lyndsey had gone around and this short hall ended at the staff locker rooms and restrooms.
	
	Of course I opened the ladies room door looking for her. I brought my flashlight up, went around the corner, shone it straight ahead, and there was someone staring back at me out of the dark by the sinks.
	
	I knew it wasn’t Lyndsey. Too tall and the hair was more like mine.
	
	I flipped my goddamn lid.
	
	I screamed like a teapot and I dropped my flashlight and I scrambled back out of there on my hands and knees trying to remember how to breathe.
	
	That’s when Lyndsey found me. Apparently she’d been looking around in the men’s locker room when she heard me.
	
	She told me to shhhh and said to calm down.
	
	I started laughing. I said “Oh god I’m so dumb.” Laughs and nerves.
	
	Lyndsey asked what I meant and I told her, “It’s just that I saw myself in the mirror and proceeded to wet my damn pants because I’m so dumb. The goddamn mirror.”
	
	I really did feel stupid about it.
	
	Lyndsey helped me up and we both went back into the women's locker room to get my flashlight.
	
	It was still lit, there on the ground, so I snatched it up quick. And right away Lyndsey put her hand around my wrist.
	
	“Jen, we have to get out of here.”
	
	She tried to tug me away, toward the door.
	
	I wondered what put her in such a pinch, but then I saw it too.
	
	Dusty glass shards covered the floor. All of the mirrors had been broken ages ago, god knows when, and there was nothing — I mean nothing — left hanging on the walls above the sinks.
	
	Whatever I saw it hadn’t been my reflection.
	
	We got the hell out of that room. And we got out of the service hall and went back to where Adam’s crew was loading up on the docks.
	
	I still had my flashlight in my fist, beam shining, as we all drove out through the gates. Megan and Jake had to tell me to turn it off.
	
	The next day I thought, maybe it was just the tile. Tile can be shiny enough to reflect a shadow or a shape or even a face. But really? I knew what I’d seen.
	
	And that was my first ghost. It wasn’t the last. And it definitely wasn’t the worst.
	
	I know it’s a big cliche to say “that’s when it all began.” For Lyndsey that night sort of was where it all began. That’s when she found the notebook in locker 112 and started all that trouble.
	
	But maybe the reason it’s a cliche to say so is, there’s never really a clear beginning to anything. What happened to Lyndsey was set in motion long before we ever walked into that mall.
	
	Maybe she knows that now too. Maybe that’s why she reached out to me today. “We never should have gone to the Gazette,” she said. Still thinking about the night we broke into the offices on 24th, where we had our run-in with those men from the church.
	
	Maybe she’s right.
	
	Personally I’ve never lost sleep over that. Someone died. But he deserved that.
	
	I’d love to know if Lyndsey really regrets it after all these years. I hope it hasn’t been gnawing at her. After I got that message I invited her to coffee (which was sort of our favorite way to rebel back then).
	
	She hasn’t responded yet. I hope to god she says yes.

	“We’ll talk later Allita. Right now I have to handle this scumbag.” I said gesturing towards Steven.” Carson yells angrily,” what the fuck did you do to us you bastard!” Steven has a puzzled look on his face. “Do what to you? I didn’t do anything!” He asked confused. I yell back,”Like hell you didn’t. Remember your party last Saturday? We know your ‘party’ was just a cover for you to sell drugs. We know your parents work for the government and have been experimenting on innocent high schoolers! You and your parents did this shit to us!” He responds,” yes that party was a drug party, and yes my parents do work for the government but what the hell are you talking about? Do what to you?” Carson let out a low growl while letting his eyes glow, while I begin to levitate and pick up a few items with me. “This.” I replied coldly. Taken aback Steven says,” What the actual fuck!” Carson says,” you did this to Ellie and I, Alitta, and Rebecca! She is the whole reason why Jake was found dead and I believed I killed him.  You made Rebecca this!” Rebecca let out a laugh. Steven then replies,” Rebecca was born a vampire numb skull When we first fell in love and she told me about her secret I let her feed on me. I’m the reason why she is even alive. I never did this to her or you.” But then how do you explain what happened to Carson, Alitta, and I?” I respond.
	
	“You dumb ass cunt.” Alitta says. “Watch it.” Carson growls lowly. Rolling her eyes,” My name literally means ‘seer of death’. My mother is a local medium and I inherited the gift. I only realized I had it when my first spirit, Jake, came to me. Actual mediums draw the attention of spirits and try to help them find answers so they can move on. Jake wanted me to find his killer and he led me to you too. The last thing he remembered was Carson changing in front of him. Maybe you would’ve known this if you stopped and listened to me.” I stared at her in awe. “But Rebecca killed Jake.” Carson says. Not as her usual bitchy self Rebecca comes forward and says,” I wanted to do something good for a change. Yes, even though murder isn’t good, I had a good reason. Ellie was roofied by Jake. He was most likely going to sell her to human traffickers. Unfortunately for him, Carson noticed and tried to protect Ellie. That’s why Ellie had the black outs and Carson changing for the first time is why he doesn’t remember, the primal side of him came out and took over everything. Anyway, Jake started the fight when Carson tried to stop him and then the power went off because Ellie was roofied but was still in it a bit and feared for Carson’s safety.” Alitta chimed in,” This was when something unlocked in the both of you. It was the emotion and the fear of loosing one another that allowed your powers to come out.”
	
	“What are you implying?” Carson gulped. “ You two weren’t and never will be apart of an experiment run by the government, you two are naturally this way. Carson is naturally a werewolf and you Ellie can naturally move things with your mind  and produce sonic screams and who knows what else.” “Impossible! Somebody did this to Carson and I! A person can’t be unlocked like that. People can’t naturally move shit with their mind. People can’t defy the laws of physics and who knows what other science laws!” I collapse and break down. Everything I ever thought was a lie. The supernatural does exist and I’m not even natural, maybe not even human, not anymore at least. And Carson, poor Carson. I shouldn’t be able to do this. I suddenly feel an embrace. Carson is wrapped around me crying  along with me. We’ve both just learned a terrible, terrible truth.
	
	...
	
	A week has gone by and now it is Friday. Steven is throwing Carson and I a party to celebrate moving on in life. Senior year is around the corner and school is almost out. We’ve made peace with our new reality. And we have a stronger bond than ever. And surprisingly we’ve come out of this endeavor with 3 new friends. Carson swore not to leave my side and make sure I wasn’t roofied this time. As we dance among our peers ‘We Are Young’ by fun comes on. Carson and I start to dance and enjoy ourselves for a bit. When the song hits its its iconic corus Carson and my eyes meet. I feel a burst of emotion and love and care for this man standing in front of me. In his eyes I could see it too. I don’t know if it was everything that had happened in the last 2 weeks or the fact that we are childhood best friends with a strong bond and connection but we leaned in close and our lips touched. We kissed. It was a great first kissed with somebody I truly loved and he loved me back. It was a kiss with deep passion behind it. I was content with the world at that moment even though it had thrown so many hardships at Carson and I. At least now we know. We finally have our answers. If you had asked me 3 weeks ago if I thought the supernatural was real I would say no. Now, I would still say no but in reality I know now that yes the supernatural does exist. And I never would have known if I hadn’t gone to that stupid party and experienced those strange changes with my best friend Carson.

	When I was younger, I was terrified of the dark. And not your average fear, a fear that would dissolve any chance of any bodily movement, one that would cause such a panic to rise into my chest that when it hit, all I could do is sit and cry for my mother to come save me. But I was not afraid of the dark itself, only what lingered in it.
	
	From the ages of 6-10 I used to hate staying in my own bedroom, because of him. Even the thought of being in there alone would cause the panic in my chest to begin to grow, the panic that I know far too well. I was alwats a highly sensitive child so any type of fright or scare would send me spiralling into a chasm of anxiety. My mother, was the only person who could console me when I broke down, there was something about her that brought a euphoria of peace and safety. We were always very close, I never had much friends growing up so I spent most of my time at her side. My dad walked out on us when I was 4, which of course left it's mark on all of us, but not her. She never seemed phased by it, she was strong, she had to be for us. And we adored her for it. She was always interested in mediums and fortune tellers, even more so after the divorce. They seemed to give her peace, and as long as she was okay, we were okay. Over the years she would occasionally have interactions with what she said were spirits. Nothing major; a misplaced item, the sound of footsteps. But there was one time that she swore she felt something breathing on her. We never fully believed her but I would very soon come to realise her judgement was apt.
	
	Our house was a 2 story, 4 bedroom. Quite a big house for a single mother to afford so it was her pride and joy. My brother and sister and I never had any paranormal incidents, that was until we moved bedrooms. My original room was the box room, a tiny space made only for an office. You could fit a bed and a wardrobe at a push, it was filled with comic book posters and action figures, an average 6 year olds room. Across the hall was my sisters, she was only 4 at the time so her room was bright pink, covered in Barbie dolls and glitter. Beside hers was my older brothers, he was 12, so he covered his room with horror movie memorabilia and football boots and posters. I remember one night my sister woke up crying, saying she heard something in her room, she never woke up like this so it was a shock for my mother and this continued to happen as the days went on, progressing to a point where she wouldn't even want to sleep in there anymore, spending most nights sleeping with our mother. Not a week later and me and her had switched rooms. It was then I first met him.
==================================================
My next door neighbour, Donny, has been replaced and only I have noticed

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dphwva/my_next_door_neighbour_donny_has_been_replaced/


	“Good morning sweetheart!” exclaimed Estelle. I’ve always liked her, since I was a kid. Her then golden brown locks have now faded into grey. Her eyes, on the other hand, still shone the most beautiful shade of emerald green. Estelle and her husband, Donny, were like the parents I never had. I still remember those summer days, when even my music at full volume couldn’t drown out my parents’ yelling. It was so comforting knowing I could turn to the people right next door when it got too much. Even if its been years, Donny still makes me laugh, and his smile feels like home. Even if it’s lost its vibrant red colour, his hair is still just as curly as it was a decade ago.
	
	“Morning! Hey, it’s been a while since ive seen Donny. Hows he doing?” I responded.
	She gave me the weirdest look.
	“Sweetie, who are you talking about?” She asked, sounding somewhat concerned.
	I started laughing a bit. She’s got to be kidding, right?
	“....Donny? ...Your husband?” I let out a nervous chuckle.
	“Samantha you’re so funny! I knew you were bad with names, but c’mon you’ve known us for years!”
	Behind her, a man came out of their house and started approaching my driveway. Once he got to us, he wrapped his arm around Estelle’s shoulder and flashed me a smile. Chills ran down my spine. Who the hell is this guy?
	
	Everything about him set off alarm bells in my head. Why was he wearing Donny’s clothes? For a few seconds I just stood there, wondering why this strange man was wearing Donny’s white and dark green plaid sweater and his white woollen gloves Estelle had made herself. The arthritis in her frail fingers made it difficult for her to knit, those gloves took her weeks to make. So, she wouldn’t let just about anyone have them. Everything is off about this guy. None of his features resemble Donny’s, none at all. And his eyes... I’m not quite sure how to describe them.  Every time I look into them, a wave of fear and anguish washes over me. I’ve known Donny since I was 12, for a huge chunk on my life. It’s not like I made up my childhood and teenage years, so who the hell was this guy?
	
	Estelle smiled, “Doug, honey we better get going if we want to get to Tamara’s house on time!”
	Tamara is their adult daughter, that I know. But Doug? No. It’s always been Estelle and Donny. Not Estelle and ... Doug? This has to be some kind of sick joke.
	“Yes hun, we better get going. See you soon Sammy!” Enthusiastically said the strange man through an unnatural smile.
	Without saying goodbye, I ran back inside my house. Only Donny was allowed to call me Sammy, who does this guy think he is? And where is Donny, is he ok?
	
	I rushed around my room looking for  my old photo album. There it was, still tucked behind my dresser. I ran my finger along its patterned cover, almost scared to open it. To my dismay, once I did, the Donny I knew wasn’t in any of the photos. Instead the lifeless, cold eyes of the stranger I met outside stared back at me.
	This can’t be possible, I literally remember taking those photos with Don. My heart started racing, I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. As I raise my hand up to my chest, my fingers fall upon a silver locket. It was given to me by Estelle and Doug and has a photo of all three of us inside. I remember the day they gave it to me, when no else had even remembered my birthday. Trembling out of fear that Donny has once again been replaced, I slowly open the locket. I closed my eyes, and took a deep breath before looking. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to handle it if my last trace of him is gone. I open my eyes, and let out a sigh. There he was, my Donny. One of the very few people I could trust. His wild red hair curled out in all different directions, Estelle right next to him wearing her favourite yellow dress and then, me.
	
	After a while of staring at my wall, confused, terrified and not knowing what to do about the situation, I decided to go on a walk to clear my head. The breeze hitting my face was so refreshing and sitting on my favourite park bench was so comforting. Though, I couldn’t get the weird encounter out of my mind. Should I contact authorities? For all I know that stranger could have done something to Donny. I really hope he’s alright. The thought of him being in danger crushed me.
	
	To comfort myself, I went to look at the one photo I have left of him. This time, to my horror, Donny wasn’t there anymore. Yet again, my eyes met the stranger’s. Tears start to stream down my face, out of fear and confusion. How could the picture have changed if it was around my neck this entire time? I quickly closed the locket. As I ran my thumb and finger over the ovuler locket to find the slightest hint of comfort, going over the letters of my name  spelled out on its front, something felt wrong. Like I did since I was very young, I went over the S, then the A, but... the next letter felt wrong. I turned over to look at it, like I have many times before. Expecting to see ‘Samantha’ written in a beautiful cursive font, my heart dropped. Right there, clear as day, in the same font: Sadie.
==================================================
Midnight at the Mausoleum

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dphv2t/midnight_at_the_mausoleum/


	There was but one corpse left in the mausoleum when they found me.
	
	In due time you will learn of how it got that way. But first you must know my name - Carson Forte. It is one that has been with me even before birth, if you can believe it, because with it carried the expectation of a household name that boasted resilience, perseverance, hard work and, altogether, strength. Indeed, the last name Forte derives from the Italian word strong, so it goes without saying that my birth name already instilled in me something to aspire to and emulate. Of course, with lineage dating back to farmers and herders in the old country, the word strength certainly referred to something more daunting and physical, particularly in terms of what it meant to pursue a career.
	
	I became a writer. A little known fact amongst my family that spread like wildfire after that fateful day I revealed to my parents of my passion for the written word.
	
	“So you, like, write words and stuff?”
	“Yes, ma, I write words and stuff.”
	“And you can get paid for that?”
	
	Money. It was always everything anything boiled down to. Try telling an Italian that money means nothing and you might get a schiaffo across the forehead. Very little is done with elegance and grace in much of the Italian culture, save for food, perhaps. But food meant nothing to me if I couldn’t write about it. Too, food meant nothing if I couldn’t afford it.
	
	Which is why I was hoping to finish one of the seven manuscripts I had going at the moment.
	
	See, the issue with me is that I begin to write something and it suddenly becomes lost within the pantheon of works that boast the incomplete sticker come the end of the year. If only I had the perseverance like my name suggested to finish one of these things, I might just be able to query it and obtain an agent and secure a publishing deal. Then I could look upon my passion as an actual profession. I could actually mitigate with pride my relationship with my family and friends.
	
	I could probably even afford food.
	
	As you can tell, this deliberation has inspired bipolar thoughts within my mind. At once crude and frustrating, and altogether exciting and ambitious, my passion for the written word extends far beyond just a schoolboy hobby. I love crafting characters that leap off the page, that become colourful and shaded as the story progresses; too, I love the idea of taking readers on a journey, that being able to help them forget their woes for a few hours provides them with joy, surprise, shock, terror and perhaps even helping to ignite inspirations of their own. How wonderful it would be to share my voice with others, and in turn being able to affect them in such a way that inspires them to raise their voices within the maelstrom of shit being said every day. There’s no better feeling, I think, than that.
	
	But who’s to say my voice is anything worth listening to at all? Hell, whenever I hear my voice played back in a recording I cringe. I coddle up inside and my organs whiplash in my stomach. I feel like exhaling a great amount of muck, as the sheer stupidity of my voice reverberates in a world that doesn’t deserve to hear it’s ugliness.
	
	Maybe that’s why I prefer books. After all, aren’t they just words on a page, waiting to be brought to life by some reader in a cozy armchair?
	Indeed, thought I, but first there needed to be words on that page. This was a problem as of late. It’s a thing that many like to call writer’s block, but that I like to call something much more crude and on-the-nose.
	
	Performance issues.
	
	Two words that any biologically active being dreads. And isn’t being a writer much like being a biologist? Of course, far from it in terms of the science and the smarts involved, but more along the lines of how the reproduction process occurs.
	
	Are writers not reproducing at sometimes exponential rates? Forming words from random letters, and placing them into sentences; and aren’t sentences put together in such a way as to create bodies, bodies of paragraphs, yes, but more to the point, the pieces of a larger sequence, a larger story? That was how I looked at things. Unusual, I know, and probably brimming with plot holes, but it was a process that I often found exhilarating to think about and particularly exciting to be apart of.
	
	Imagine my irritation, then, as my mind became plagued with a heavy case of performance issues one solitary night. It was the night of July 12th, to be exact, and a cool air complimented the silvery moonlight as it fell upon the measly fire escape of my measly apartment. I often sat out on the rusted metal steps late at night, tablet in hand, either brainstorming or full on writing stories. I admired this time of day - late night, almost midnight - because the world was quiet and it helped me think. Ideas often flowed like waves in my mind, kissing the beach with delicate grace, then retreating back into the recesses of my mind whenever something wasn’t clicking. Then, with a crash, the wave would come back with something novel and inspiring, and sometimes, that wave created a ripple effect that turned into a story.
	
	Tonight, that just wasn’t happening. I don’t know why, and I’m sure there isn’t an exact science to it, but my brain just couldn’t perform at the level I would have liked it to. I needed to finish this novel. Even this chapter would be nice! But some supernatural force was impaling my efforts at every turn. My hand stayed as I found the digital keyboard, my mind paused as I looked at the abundance of white, of nothingness.
	
	If only I had the encouraging words of the one person who really did believe in me. I reminded myself that she was gone. Gone, for almost four years, now. She had been taken from this world far too soon, sickened by a cancer that blackened her brain and ate away at the memories that would exist like ethereal orbs in the back of my mind.
	
	Memories, all of them whirling in the harddrive of thoughts since that day I was forced to say goodbye. Jenna. Her name was Jenna, and she had the most beautiful blonde hair. It flowed upon her shoulders in delicate abandon, and would glisten within the moonlight on nights like tonight. Her hands were tiny, soft and skinny, and when they touched you it wasn’t coarse or rough, but gentle. She was a nurse, but that didn’t stop her hands from being the number one thing she loved to tend to. Often soaked in water, and often chewed at from the demands of her job, Jenna made it a point to upkeep them to the best of her ability. And it showed. No set of hands in all the land matched my beautiful fiancee’s.
	
	And now they were gone, with nobody left to hold them.
	
	Sadness crept in from some dark place in my mind. The blue light from the tablet shot up and drenched my face in perpetual sorrow. Or at least, that’s how I imagined it looked from anyone watching me down below. I locked the screen and placed its body gently down upon the rusted stair. I looked out over the town as it began its slumber in the heart of night. Not a soul navigated those empty streets. It was quiet, bristling with a faint aura that I couldn’t quite define. And there in the distance I could see it.
	
	The mausoleum. As my eyes fixated upon that holy place even the sounds of wildlife began to dim. A hushed silence wafted over me, bleeding with possibility and drive.
	
	Oftentimes I would find an isolated spot to write. My bedroom, this fire escape, the library; so why not try writing someplace else tonight? Perhaps that was my issue - a lack of surroundings that encouraged blistering thought. With that idea in mind I picked up the tablet and grabbed my sweater. It was cool out tonight, and I had no working knowledge of how long I would be in that space. Sometimes, when I really got into the routine of writing, hours would pass by without me even realizing it. Those were the most fruitful occasions, and I could only hope this change of scenery would allow me that experience tonight.
	
	A ten minute trek brought me to the entrance of the mausoleum. The clock struck midnight as I studied the marble build of the structure. A white and grey sheen extended across the upper plane of the mausoleum; below, black lines searched like veins through the pristine body of the immaculate stone. A set of stairs, marble also, ushered you in to the place like some grand entryway to a castle. Hanging from either end of that entrance were pots of flowers that spilled out over their confines. A rainbow of colour greeted the eye from that spot, with foliage ranging from every lineage of leaf. Wonder often overcame me as I visited this holy place of remembrance. So detailed and so brilliant was its make that anybody who saw it became floored by its magnificence.
	
	I walked up the stairs and punched in the code that unlocked the door. A confirmation beep acknowledged my command and the door easily opened as I pulled my way in. A dead silence greeted me upon arrival, and a faint musty smell welcomed me forward. It was all so familiar to me now; after having visited Jenna’s grave for over four years, the routine became simple and the landscape, knowable. To my immediate right was a set of stairs that lead to the upper level of the mausoleum. To my left stood a set of doors that lead to the east wing of the building. There, more graves decorated the walls from either end of the windowed halls, and up, up, up those graves went to the second floor, visible from down below.
	
	Before me, upon entering the mausoleum, was a small chapel area where funeral processions were often held. It was empty now, but I will always remember the amount of people that populated that space for Jenna’s ceremony. Friends, family and colleagues all crowded into that space, exceeding the maximum capacity that the mausoleum staff like to follow. There were just too many people Jenna had socialized with in life, that in death there just couldn’t be any proper satisfaction with saying goodbye to everyone.
	
	I walked into that chapel and took a seat at one of the pews near the back end. An enormous stain-glass window stood over the podium near the front of the space, depicting the Lord Almighty. Here, the moonlight was drenched a deep crimson red, falling ethereally through the painted panes of glass. My eyes studied that depiction of Christ. Thoughts altogether foreign to my mind blistered in and out of consciousness.
	
	The space was silent. Serene. Peaceful, yet tinged with a sense of morbidity that became almost overwhelming.
	
	What was I doing here? I was in the middle of writing a romance, for Christ’s sake! This was a mistake coming here, as it often was, according to my family and friends. A sense of attachment hovered over me these past few years since Jenna’s death, and it wouldn’t let go. It was with an iron grip that her memory grabbed onto my heart and plagued my mind with notions of depression and death. Shaking that feeling would often prove to be a difficult task. More difficult, even, than kickstarting my imagination out of one of my writer’s blocks.
	
	But what instantly helped that issue, believe it or not, was writing. Writing, even for the sake of putting something down on paper. If it was less than stellar, than I would edit it. If it was absolute trash, then I would binge on alcohol and write something else. This was the routine that helped me continue with my writing.
	
	At least, it was the routine I had fallen into since she had passed.
	
	Nevermind that now. Blocking her from my memory, I arose from my seat and strolled down the alley of graves. It never saddened me to see these plaques remembering the dead the way it might for anyone else. Instead, I reveled in the knick-knacks that many of the families had placed at the foot of their loved one’s stones. Crucifixes were the most common artifacts found, yet sometimes one would often more surprising objects that revealed the more eclectic tastes of the dead. Jewelry, handbags, money, alcohol and even literature graced the shelves of those cremated in death, and from these examples I often took inspiration for characters in my stories.
	
	Tonight, a one Julia Dawson captured my attention. An unfortunate demise, yielded from the birth date and the death date. Like Jenna my beloved, Julia had perished much too early. The girl’s parents had plastered photos of her in grade school, middle school, and high school. Pictures that showed Julia living a life of exuberance, happiness and livelihood. Beside those photographs were medals and trophies won at her local school’s track meet. First place all around. An athletically gifted student. My attention was then brought towards a newspaper clipping taped to the side of her grave revealing a tragic ATV accident that took the poor girl’s life.
	
	Unfortunate still was the implication in the article that the accident had occurred because of an abundance of alcohol. It was a sad, depressing affair that emanated from this Julia Dawson character.
	
	I would probably use her as the main character’s wily roommate in my novel. Lovestruck, torn and on edge, the main character would go to her for advice, and find from a drunk friend the solace of friendship and respect. I could imagine the scene then: the two characters meet in a bar, drudge on about life and work and love; drink, get drunk, and wander home in each other’s arms knowing well enough that their friendship would last longer than any relationship tried at by some man and his woes.
	
	And zombies, maybe I’d throw in some flesh-eating creatures for good measure. A good Romero-esque tone and atmosphere once the infection begins to spread.
	
	Horror, now, really? I reminded myself that this began as a love story, realizing then that it was quickly becoming something for Weird Tales.
	You see? You see the way my mind prods and wanders?
	
	The path lead me deeper into the mausoleum’s labyrinthine halls. Lights flickered as I rounded each corner down every walkway. Shadows seemed to dance before my eyes; from a writing high or from exhaustion, I cannot tell, but an imposing atmosphere seemed to creep in as I ventured deeper into that place of the dead.
	
	As time passed so too did my inability to craft story and character. In fact, visiting that mausoleum was just the tonic I needed to keep instigating the details of my story. Julia Dawson was the first character I fleshed out, but she was certainly not the last. With wild verve I outlined seventeen characters that would populate my novel - everyone from the main character’s parents (names taken from an old Polish couple next to Julia’s grave), her boss at work (a particularly evil-looking bat two spots above the Polish couple’s), her gay best friend (the husband of a woman who’s photograph was doused in some hazing material), and the man she would eventually fall for (a man, young and seemingly free-spirited in life judging by the photos of him wearing jeans and sandals).
	
	The zombies would probably eat him, first. I had no doubt about it then. And as I walked through that gruesome setting of decaying corpses, I managed to fill the roster that my mind had previously abandoned only a short time ago.
	
	Meticulously, and quite frankly, simply, I managed to outline the characters that had eluded me before entering that mausoleum. It was as if I had stolen from the dead their identities and given them something else to live for. Was that considered grave robbing? The notion circled my mind like ravens taunting their prey. Perhaps it was, yet not in any traditional sense of the term.
	
	Trite though it may seem, my irreverent high came crashing down with the chorus of moaning that echoed those empty halls of the mausoleum. I had seen no one else enter or leave that space in the hour I had been there, nor were there any staff members who had announced their nightly rounds during the graveyard shift. I was alone, completely and utterly isolated from the world outside. The shadows that tricked my mind earlier had slithered their way back into the landscape of the dead. A shivery blast climbed up the otherwise sweaty shirt that had clung to my back in the marathon of creativity.
	
	Suddenly the lights dimmed. It was an altogether slow, imposing gesture that haunted the space before me. The act was not unlike that of a cinema’s routine show, when just before the previews begin the crowd gathers and that the lights dim on cue. Now, the fluorescent light offered a sickening glow to the space. Disease and gross inadequacy foiled my mind as I ventured into that mausoleum. Like a neglected Mayan temple, the halls of the mausoleum became ancient and full of doom. Centuries of decay had suddenly entered that space and filled its corridors with the putrid stench of a rotting corpse.
	
	I shielded my nose from this disgust. As if a fan had suddenly blasted a fresh wave of blister and death, the air became humid and dry with the nightmarish quality of a morgue. Scenes of flesh and blood darted into my mind like a projection at twenty-four frames per second. My balance became weakened and stale. I fumbled to the side of the hallway and caught my balance upon an open casket.
	
	An open casket.
	
	The shock nearly tackled me to the ground, loosening the bag of air that kept its abundant supply healthy and whole. I gagged. The smell overpowered my senses - all of my senses, all at once, and I couldn’t see before me any longer.
	
	The dimness of the light played more tricks with my eyes, and shadows moved like jackals around the corners of the mausoleum. A soft but sinister clicking sound reverberated those stone halls, and formless figures seemed to ballet with the darkness that seeped into the space. My head darted back and forth to try and catch a glimpse of what exactly it was that moved in front of me.
	
	Failure reigned as my eyes couldn’t quite adjust to the freakishly fast movements of the figures. I only just found my footing as my eyes finally came into focus.
	
	What stood before me was a complete and utter abomination in the truest sense of the word. A corpse, scabbed and abraded with rotting flesh, stared me down from across the corridor. Its bones hung from the meager skeleton that peaked from the peeled skin of years of decay. Its eyes were no longer eyes but sockets within which black orbits hovered into. The pupils had digressed long ago, leaving only the hollow tombs for eyes long dead and gone. In that regard, the thing wasn’t quite staring at me - but it was staring at me. The thing was aware of my weak and frightened presence, and it could smell the fear that emanated from my sweaty palms and hear the horror I felt from my chattering teeth.
	
	A calm, assured step brought the corpse closer towards me. Only for a second did my fear trump any sense of flight, but once my body reacted to the scenario I was away and gone out of that corridor like a flash of light. I rounded the corner and headed for the door - yet, the the door was all the way down at the main level, and the corpse had been blocking the stairway leading down to it. Luckily, the mausoleum was designed like a square, so as the corpse followed my path away from that hallway, I only had to come back around to reach the doorway that would now stand clear of any rotting inhabitants.
	
	Sure enough, I managed to make it down the stairs and away from that horrible, gruesome, nightmarish fiend. Though, just as I was about to round the corner for the entrance, a second, unfamiliar corpse blocked my path. It too had been discarded by the years of decomposition, and from it wafted an even more unbelievable stench than the last. This corpse was older, I thought, and it clearly showed.
	
	That corpse was no less agile, though. It ventured towards me with mindless zeal, spewing from its throat a thick, guttural cry that yearned for something more lively than death. Tonight would not be the night I would allow it that satisfaction.
	
	As the shadows continued their operatic show, I posited a path towards the backdoor. Now, that door was normally shut and locked for the night, as the tenants of the mausoleum often advertised upon their displays, but it was no less worth trying to escape this horrific scene. In terms of worst case scenarios, shattering the glass wouldn’t be entirely bad, especially given the circumstances.
	
	Yet as I came to that doorway a score of corpses now bristled along those hallways of the mausoleum. In favor of their throaty calls came a chorus of howling cries from the dead. All seemed to pursue one thing and one thing only - me - as if they had been given a direct order by some hellish devil of the supernatural realm. My soul was on the line, I could feel it ticking in my chest like the rhythm of some Victorian era clock, both grand and bombastic, appealing to a more grandiose nature than what my mortal life seemed to be worth.
	
	Thankfully, or by some divine miracle, a trash can was placed beside the frame of the doorway. The door was locked, but with my heart beating so frantically within my chest all I could think about was with haste did I need to escape that darkening hell. So I lifted the trash can with all of my strength and aimed it precisely at the center of the door and with a great, lumbering swoop I-
	
	Lowered the trash can. From the mass of innumerable corpses came a voice that I thought I would never hear again in my life. It was a soft, melodic voice that would ensnare jealousy in even the most angelic soul. The voice belonged to my Jenna. And the voice spoke directly to me now in that dead of night.
	
	“Carson, it’s me.”
	
	I turned to face the canvas of death that bled and oozed and brittled with grisly terror. There, standing before the horde of corpses, was my Jenna. Blonde hair, though wiry and scabbed with blood, hung in sparse rows of neglect. Her face had been blackened by the darkest form of disease and decay. Unlike her fellow dead comrades, Jenna’s illness had eaten away at the beauty that so many living souls had admired for only a short while. A tragedy that such a beautiful face would be taken from this world without being captured again and again with infinite solace.
	
	My eyes saw none of that horror, though. They compelled away the demons that haunted my mind and reminded me that Jenna had been dead for over four years. No, my eyes saw the beauty that so many others had seen, that so many others had said goodbye to all those years ago, they were eyes that I could never unsee in all my life.
	
	Nor, the hands that I thought I would never be able to hold again. My eyes saw those, but not as you might see them in that dim light of death, but as they were before the illness and before her untimely demise. They reached out toward me in lonely strength, those pitiful and weak hands that had been decomposing all those years. Jenna would have fainted at the frightful sight her hands had now become. But they were still beautiful to me, warm even to the touch, as I stepped forward and delicately held on to that bruised bit of meat.
	
	“I’ve missed you,” I said to my love.
	
	“I’ve missed you, too,” said she to me in return.
	
	Behind us, the company of the dead evaporated into a dark mist that furrowed down the corridor and out of that place of remembrance forever. As stated, the mausoleum was empty.
	
	And as she cupped her cold, rotting hands upon my cheek, I felt the warm embrace of her decaying lips upon my own.
	
	That was how the officers found me.

==================================================
I’m a contestant on a new baking show. I need some tips or I might die.

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dphv0n/im_a_contestant_on_a_new_baking_show_i_need_some/


	I had been between jobs for about 6 months when the call came. Apparently, I was selected to participate in a brand new baking show that was being produced by one of the major streaming services.
	
	Weird. I didn’t remember signing up for anything like that. And, frankly, I don’t know the first thing about baking.
	
	No worries, the guy on the phone tells me. This show is specifically casting regular people to try and make outlandish baked goods. One of their competitors has a popular show like that so they’re trying to cash in.
	
	I guess one of my friends had recommended me or something, because they already had a photo of this cake I tried to make one time and, yeah… Not my proudest moment.
	
	But, hey, the grand prize of $25,000 would go a loooong way for me right now. So why the hell not.
	
	After signing a lengthy NDA, I was filled in on the rest of the details. Filming was slated to take place over a few days in their studio, and they would fly me out as well as handle my transportation to and from the airport. I just had to show up.
	
	Looking through my email now I guess I should have been suspicious that the guy emailed me from a Gmail account and not one associated with the streaming service, but who would even think to look at something like that? The whole thing seemed like it was on the up and up at the time.
	
	The day came, and I showed up a private airport near where I lived. Sure enough there was a private jet waiting for me and ready to go. Three hours later I was on the ground and being driven in the back of a fancy town car to somewhere suburban.
	
	I was told by my driver that the project was apparently pretty secretive, so they were bringing me in some back entrance. Finally we pulled up behind a large warehouse complex and I was quickly ushered through an unmarked side door.
	
	Look, I know what everybody’s thinking. And yeah, in retrospect this all seems suspicious. Trust me I’m beating myself up enough over this as is. I don’t need anybody else to pile on.
	
	So anyways I’m brought on set and it looks exactly like every baking show you’ve ever seen: 4 baking stations with fancy equipment, state of the art everything, a fully stocked pantry, and a big-ass judges table with the name of the show plastered in gaudy lettering overhead. The three other contestants are already there and I am quickly introduced.
	
	There’s Susan, a stay-at-home mom from Alabama who, in a roundabout way, blamed her mom (bless her heart) for never teaching her to bake. A burly ex-military man named Steve with tattoos down his arms and two little kids who knew never to touch anything he tried to make. And then Bob.
	
	Bob’s about as non-descript you can get for a lanky white guy who doesn’t ever seem to speak. If it weren’t for the fact that he was always smiling I might not even have given him a second look at first.
	
	And no, it wasn’t one of those creepy horror movie smiles. Just a normal smile. It just… never… went… away.
	
	After introductions one of the producers explained the concept. We would participate in 4 rounds of contests. After each round the judges would chose a winner and loser. The winner would get some kind of advantage while the loser would get some kind of punishment headed into the next round. The 4th and final round would determine who went home with the $25,000. All pretty straightforward. Finally, the host of the show was whisked on set (his name’s Ben and he looks like you’d imagine a host should). And we were off to the races.
	
	Round one was cupcakes. Each of us was given some crazy animal-inspired cupcake to replicate in one hour. I got saddled with. Some insane pig-shaped cupcake that looked impossible. Susan had a cow. Poor Steve was stuck with this really elaborate lion. Bob didn’t seem to have a cupcake of his own but I was too preoccupied freaking out about my pig to think too much about it.
	
	Thankfully they gave us a recipe to follow, but it honestly wasn’t much help. I don’t know if any of you have used fondant before but man that shit is much harder to work with than it looks like on TV. Also, I forgot to add salt to my batter. Oops. At least the damn things sort of looked like a pig when I was through, which was more than could be said for Steve’s “lion.”
	
	After we were done the production paused so they could make sure to get good intro shots of the three judges. We were also told to act all wowed each time one was introduced like we had any idea who these people are. Like, I’m sure that lady makes good cupcakes but she’s no household name. But since I guess they might be famous to some people I’ll just call them Tom, Sally, and Barbara.
	
	One at a time we were asked to step forward with our cupcakes. Susan went first, and damn if her cow didn’t actually look pretty good. It must have tasted alright too because she got some decent comments from the judges.
	
	I went second, and while I got some compliments on my cupcakes at least looking like a pig, the judges immediately picked up on the fact that I’d forgotten salt. Each one felt the need to hint at the “consequences” for losing a round. At the time I thought it was just to build drama and didn’t think anything of it.
	
	Next was Steve. Poor Steve. His lion was just a blob of colors, and the cupcake itself wasn’t even fully baked. The judges weren’t even subtle anymore when talking about whatever punishment was coming.
	
	And yet Steve looked to be safe when Bob stepped forward with nothing. Silent as ever, he made a big mime-like show of presenting nothing to the judges, placing each fake cupcake in front of them with elaborate yet dainty hand gestures as if he was being super careful to present them just so.
	
	“Wow,” said Tom.
	
	“Unbelievable,” echoed Sally.
	
	“Bob, this is… quite something,” added Barbara.
	
	I could hear an audible sigh of relief coming from Steve’s direction.
	
	“You’ve spoiled us again, Bob,” said Tom, delight spreading across his face.
	
	“If this tastes even half as good as it looks… You three need to watch out,” exclaimed Sally, pointing at the rest of us.
	
	“I just can’t wait to dig in!” Barbara was practically bouncing in her seat.
	
	What. The. Fuck.
	
	I watched as each of the judges picked up their… air and started to “eat” it.
	
	The comments were glowing. Each judge trying to one-up the last with praise until finally Tom chimed in.
	
	“Do we even need to pretend to deliberate or can we just declare a winner for this round?”
	
	A producer came forward and let them know they did have to at least pretend to deliberate.
	
	I looked over at Steve, who was stunned. I elbowed him playfully and said “hey, cheer up. There’s no competing with that.”
	
	He looked at me with horror.
	
	“You mean… you can see..?”
	
	I cut him off and whispered “Nah, man. But I figure this is probably some kind of weird prank, right. Let’s just play along. There’s still $25,000 at the end of this for one of us, yeah?”
	
	I wish I hadn’t said that. I wish we had just run.
	
	After a few minutes we did the reveal takes. Bob won. Steve lost. We learned that at least 5 times before the producer was satisfied with Steve’s look of disappointment. Bob’s utter glee was perfect every time, apparently.
	
	When we started back up Ben was explaining again how the winner gets an advantage and the loser gets “punished.” I stared down at my shoes feeling lucky but also just confused. How did we all lose to… well nothing.
	
	“Bob, as your prize for this round is that you get to chose your own ingredients for round 2! As for Steve’s punishment, well, why don’t I let Bob demonstrate that.”
	
	Bob turned to Steve with childlike glee across his face as he moved his hands up to cup his chin in an over-the-top expression. He glanced up and down at Steve and then raised his left fist to his chin in a recognizable “thinking” posture.
	
	“Time’s up Bob, make your decision.”
	
	Wait, what decision.
	
	Bob had begun to slowly, slowly dip his hand into his apron pocket. He proceeded to just as slowly withdraw a dull but ordinary spoon and raise it all the way up between his eyes.
	
	Then faster than I could fully process he pounced at Steve.
	
	Steve raised his hands to defend himself but it did him no good. In less than a second he was on the ground pinned by the much smaller Bob and looking helpless.
	
	“GET THE FUCK OFF OF ME!” He shouted. Susan and I looked at each other unsure what to do.
	
	“Bob, what the fuck are you…” I started, but before I could continue I felt strong arms wrapping around me and saw that Susan was being similarly grabbed from behind. I tried to struggle, but look it’s been a while since I’ve been to the gym ok.
	
	Meanwhile Steve continued to punch at Bob and struggle under the smaller man’s surprising strength. Bob hardly seemed to notice. Instead he began to move the spoon, which was by his side, even more slowly up towards Steve’s face.
	
	“GET OFF ME YOU FUCKER. GET THAT THING AWAY FROM ME, YOU… YOU… FUCK MAN. NO! NO! PLEASE GOD NO! PLEASE DON’T AGHHHHHHH!!!!!”
	
	Bob dove the spoon into one of Steve’s eyes, twisted it around and pulled the eye out brandishing it like a kid might some toy they’d just won at a carnival. Steve was sobbing and begging but instead of stopping Bob proceeded to the other eye and…
	
	I looked away. I couldn’t take it anymore.
	
	“Great choice of ingredient, Bob!” said Ben. “Now why don’t we call it a night and then tomorrow we can all come back and start Round Number 2!”
	
	So, yeah. Now I’m sitting in a cell in this warehouse typing this out hoping beyond hope that I can get a signal to post to Reddit. I’ve tried calls, emails, nothing seems to be working. But if anybody reads this please send help to… somewhere? Fuck I should have paid more attention on the ride out. I’m not even sure what city I’m in.
	
	Oh, and also any tips on how to bake better? It may literally be life and death for me.
==================================================
My little girl made a new friend named Mary

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dphuyc/my_little_girl_made_a_new_friend_named_mary/


	I really didn’t think I’d find myself there that day, standing over the burial plot of one of my childhood best friends.  My husband lovingly held me close to him, rubbing my right arm, which held our daughter’s hand.  I wiped my nose, trying to keep it together for the kiddo, but was emotionally devastated as they lowered Tess into the ground.  She was only 28 years old when the accident happened.  She was in her apartment complex and, according to the police report, slipped on the stairs one night, falling down a few flights and ultimately suffering severe damage to the head and neck. She was announced brain dead about a week later, and her grieving family decided to pull the plug.  I wasn’t mad at them, nor did I blame them; I knew it was what she would have wanted.  Still, this wasn’t supposed to happen. You’re not supposed to be burying friends your age, not when you’re in your twenties.  She was an amazing writer, friend, and aunt to her nieces and nephews, whom she adored.  Annie, her goddaughter, who was the same age as my little one Alaina, stood opposite us; they were both six years old at the time.  All of the young faces in the cemetery wept for her that day.
	
	With her family’s permission of course, I visited her apartment about a week later.  I had no intention of moving or touching anything, really; I just wanted to see it exactly as she had left it.  Tess was both extremely tidy and a complete mess at the same time.  Her tiny white kitchen was clean, with dishes stacked up drying, and her favorite mug in the sink, a splash of light pink lipstick on the rim.  The artwork above that sink was a tiny print of Monet’s water lillies, and the cat portrait on the wall next to her kitchen table made me smile; she had painted it back in college, of the tabby orange kitty we shared and had named Butterscotch, or Butters for short.  There was a bulky and more than half-dead sunflower in the delicate vase on her kitchen table, which had one of the two chairs pulled out.  I ran my fingers over the surface as I walked into her warm living room.  Her purple jacket was thrown over the left side of her loveseat, and she had an Indy record in her player in the corner. I had been avoiding her room at this point, but finally mustered up the courage to go in there and look around.
	
	As I entered, the scent of her perfume hit me hard.  Tears started to well up but I held them back, choosing to smile at her memory instead.  I should have registered that it had been a week, and her perfume hadn’t been sprayed in at least that long, but I didn’t at the time. I flicked on the lamp in the corner instead of the overhead, like she always did, and was drawn straight to her desk, which was overrun with notes and stories.  They weren’t neatly stacked or organized like they usually were, which was odd.  She must have been working on something when she left that day.
	
	I hadn’t intended on touching anything, but the edge of one paper was poking off the side of her desk from under the others, almost as if it was about to fall to the ground.  I pulled it from the stack, and went to read it, but realized it wasn’t a story.  In perfect format, with indentations and paragraphs, Tess has written “she’s here” over and over, for an entire page, in her calligraphic handwriting. Incredibly freaked out, I immediately started scanning the other pages on her desk.  Nothing else was out of the ordinary, or inherently creepy, like this page was.  I skimmed the stories, looking for something horror-like; certainly this was a page she had written for effect, and was part of a larger narrative.  I couldn’t find anything that it might fit into.  I picked the page back up again, looking for something that broke that phrase, but nothing did.  It repeated exactly the same way, at least 80 times, on one page.  I noticed, though, that the bottom corner had a small “M,” almost like a child had written it.  I put down the page, called my husband, and got out of the apartment, taking the elevator.
	
	I bawled again that night, venting my concern for my friends mental health as my husband listened.  I should have spent more time with her, and talked more often.  He assured me that what I found must have been for a project of some kind, and that the fall was an accident.  Eventually I came to terms with my panic; Tess was an incredibly independent and driven woman, and the situation must still have been taking its toll on me emotionally.
	
	The day after this visit to Tess’, I picked Alaina up from school, like I always do.  It was within the first week of the school year, so I met her out front and took her hand as she told me all about her day, and all the new friends she was making.  She asked me if Auntie Tess would come over and read to her again, and I told her again, with a whole of of sadness, that she wouldn’t be visiting anymore, because she had passed away. Alaina had never experienced a death in her life, but hadn’t asked about Tess in a while either.  I asked her why she was thinking of Auntie Tess right now, and she said that her new friend Mary mentioned that she likes Auntie Tess’ stories, too. I stopped walking immediately, knelt down to my daughters height, and took her hands.
	
	“Who told you that?” I asked her.
	
	“My friend Mary! She told me that Auntie Tess writes the best stories” she replied.
	
	“That’s very sweet, honey” I replied, not wanting to scare her.
	
	None of Tess’ works were published.
	
	I calmly turned around and walked straight back into the school, explaining to Alaina that I just wanted to speak to her teacher, Ms. Steph, about her new friend Mary.
	
	“Mary?” she replied.  “We don’t have a Mary in our class.”
	
	The teacher knelt down and asked Alaina who she was talking about.
	
	“We played together at recess” Alaina replied, “and she told me she reads Auntie Tess’ stories.”
	
	“Ok,” I said to the both of them.  “Thank you Ms. Steph.  This girl must not be in your home room.  If you could look into this and get back to me, I’d really appreciate it.”
	
	“Of course!” she replied, and we were on our way.
	
	As soon as we got home, I lead Alaina to her play room and came back downstairs to speak to my husband. He agreed that what Alaina had told me was odd, so he went upstairs to speak with her.  Ten minutes later he came back down, and told me that this “Mary” was her friend, and they talked  at recess about Tess’ stories.  The little girl must have been a grade above or below her (the school is Pre-K through 5th grade) and was simply agreeing with Alaina, but her six-year-old brain ran with the idea that Mary knew and liked the stories too.  Feeling slightly better about the situation, I went back upstairs and sat with my little girl.  We played together a while, had dinner, and I put her to bed like any other night.  My husband and I watched a movie and had a glass of wine, and I decided to go check on Alaina.  I kissed him on the cheek and handed him my wine glass, then headed upstairs.
	
	When I reached Alaina’s door, I heard giggling.  I stopped and listened for a moment.  Alaina was speaking to someone.
	
	“No that’s silly!” she laughed.
	
	I didn’t hear any audible response.
	
	“Stop it, Mary!”
	
	I swung that door open so fast that it knocked a picture off her wall, shattering on the floor.  I saw my little girl sitting up ramrod straight, facing the window with her back to me, a silhouette in the darkness. I stepped into the room immediately and said her name.  The room was completely still.
	
	As the door slammed shut behind me, and I heard Alaina banging on it from the other side.
	
	She was yelling, over and over again:
	
	“She’s here!”
==================================================
I could be breaking the NDA, but at this point, I don't care.

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dphtrk/i_could_be_breaking_the_nda_but_at_this_point_i/


	I'm a VR fanboy. Anything VR, I want. I had owned the first developer kit from Oculus despite not being a developer. This year, I bought three headsets: the Rift S, the Quest and the Index. Why so much? Simple. I love VR.
	
	And since I'm crazy for virtual reality, I signed up for any alpha tests and beta tests and experiments involving VR. Recently I got to try a neural bracelet where you can “mind control” your virtual arms. *
	
	So I was psyched to get a beta invitation from Facebook. Another company was attached to the test named *VR-GL S.r.l.*, which could be a company that Facebook had acquired (they do that a lot, don't they).
	
	The email didn't mention what the beta was for. It only showed a link for the launcher, probably an MMO or the new social VR called *Horizons.* I was at work when I got the email, so the commute home was grueling.
	
	When I got home, I didn't even bother to change out of my work clothes. I booted up my PC, clicked the link in the email and downloaded the launcher. I was surprised how small it was (1 GB), which made me think it was a streaming service like Google Stadia.
	
	The icon was a black cube with the name VR-GL beta. To login, I needed to use my Facebook account, which I didn't mind since I already do this with my Oculus account. I skimmed through the ToS and NDA, then clicked "agree." Finally, I slipped my headset on.
	
	I was in outer space surrounded in pinpricks of stars and bursts of nebula. Seconds later, a woman blinked into existence.
	
	"Hi there, I'm Sharon. I'll be your guide today," she said.
	
	"I'm Jay. Nice to meet you. So is this the beta test? Outer space?"
	
	"No. You'll be testing out some advanced AI we've been developing."
	
	"Cool. Are you an AI?"
	
	Sharon grinned. "I can't confirm nor deny that. I'll let you know by the end of the test. Let's start, shall we?"
	
	Four orbs popped into view. One of them showed my home in Connecticut. Another showed my current apartment, which creeped me out a bit. The other two were Milan and London, places where I went for vacation.
	
	"Pick one," she said.
	
	I grabbed the orb that showed my apartment and pushed it towards my vision. Seconds later, I was inside my apartment, digitized of course. I could see some aliasing on my furniture, and there were areas where things were smeared. I pointed this out to Sharon.
	
	"The AI is reconstructing your apartment with photos in your account. It analyzes, estimates and reconstructs the place, basing it on deep learning and past simulations." She went to a spot where the floor seemed to smear against the wall. "Still, there are blind spots, which the AI learns to fix."
	
	Slowly, the smearing between the floor and wall became clearer.
	
	“How’s that?” she asked.
	
	“Neat.”
	
	I checked the whole living room, which was almost perfect. But my bedroom and bathroom didn’t exist because I didn’t take any photos in those areas (why would I?).
	
	“On a scale of one to ten, one being not accurate and ten being very accurate, how would you rate this reconstruction?”
	
	“To be honest? Seven.”
	
	“Thank you for your honesty. Are you ready for the next test?”
	
	I nodded, and an orb popped up in front of me. I was dreading it would be my home, but luckily it was just a ballroom. I grabbed it and went inside.
	
	Some of my friends and family were there, and they were all wearing tuxedos and fancy dresses. But they all looked eerily accurate, almost imperceptible unless you look closely and see the pixelation on their skin. If I had to guess, it was Facebook’s latest tech in mapping faces. **
	
	“Our AI reconstructs their face on to these avatars and approximates their height,” said Sharon.
	
	“I’ll give it a ten for how real they look.”
	
	Sharon grinned. “Don’t rate them yet. Go ahead and mingle.”
	
	I was already creeped out at how life-like they were, and I was going to lose my shit if their personalities were replicated.
	
	I stepped up to my mom and my ex boyfriend who were having a conversation.
	
	“Hi Jay, how are you doing today?” said my mom.
	
	“Hey asshole, I was just telling your mom how much of a dick you are to me!” said my ex.
	
	I was laughing, relieved that they were not exact replicates of my mom and ex.
	
	“How would you rate them?” asked Sharon.
	
	“I’d rate my mom as two. She’s too formal, and she doesn’t sound like that at all. I’m guessing you replicated her through my messages with her?”
	
	Sharon nodded.
	
	“My ex? I’d say six. His mannerisms and inflection are on point, but he’s too blunt,” I said. “He’s the type of guy who speaks less, but speaks a lot in social media. I guess you replicated his mannerism through the video chats we had?”
	
	“Correct again,” said Sharon.
	
	I mingled some more and gave my ratings. The people in the ballroom were people I interacted with frequently through messenger, posts and comments. No one rated a perfect ten until my little brother showed up.
	
	“Long time no see, Jay!” he said. He was ten-years old, looked exactly the last time I saw him.
	
	“No no no no no.” I quickly removed my headset.
	
	I never had VR sickness, but today was an exception. I made it to the toilet bowl and tossed out half my lunch. Literally, my surroundings started to “dissociate.” Disorientation is common after being immersed in VR for too long. Usually you acclimate to it, and it goes away. But after seeing my little brother virtually in the flesh, the disorientation came back. ***
	
	Jimmy, my little brother, would have been fourteen-years old this year. He loved vlogging, and there was always a video of him on his Facebook page. Not a lot of people watched his videos, but he didn’t care.
	
	He died when a car ran him over. The driver passed a red light, too busy texting on their phone. But if Jimmy cared to look up from his phone, he would have seen the speeding car. That was the last video on his page. I had to delete it because the sound of the collision and crunching bones was too gruesome.
	
	It took a while for me to find my head. When I logged back in, Sharon was waiting for me in outer space.
	
	"We lost you there. Glad to have you back," she said.
	
	"What the fuck was that!? Why is my brother here! Is this the real test, seeing if you can replicate my dead brother?!"
	
	Sharon cowered at my rage. "I'm sorry. Our algorithm usually removes individuals who are deceased. Again I'm deeply sorry for this. We'll review our code and remove your brother from the world."
	
	The way she phrased it made me sick.
	
	"No. Wait," I said, trying to keep it together. "Don't remove him yet."
	
	"Isn't that what you want? Do you still want to participate?"
	
	Part of me wanted to leave and swear off from Facebook and its ilk, but another part of me wanted to see him again, even if it was an imperfect replica.
	
	“I’ll stay,” I said.
	
	“Are you sure? This was not supposed to happen, and we’re apprehensive with this type of interaction.”
	
	“I want to see him.”
	
	Sharon nodded. “Pick a location, and he’ll be there, waiting for you.”
	
	I chose our home in Connecticut, the last place I saw him. The weeks leading up to my visit for the holidays had him all excited. He’d videochat in the afternoons, talking about how we’ll play a lot of video games and how he’ll show off his new creations in Minecraft.
	
	When I finally came home, I barely got to spend time with him. Friends and family and relatives all wanted to catch up. I got to see his Minecraft creations, though, but we didn’t get to game that much. I felt his disappointment when I left. You can always tell from a kid.
	
	Anyway, the virtual recreation of our house was impeccable. If I were to guess, it’s because of Jimmy’s videos, which usually is set at home.
	
	“And here’s my big brother, straight from New York City!” Jimmy said while recording a video on his phone. He ran up next to me and framed me in on his video. “Say ‘hi’!”
	
	I waved and said “hi” to a virtual phone, which did show us standing next to each other. He stopped recording and hugged me. VR is so compelling; it tricks your brain into believing things that are not there. I felt Jimmy’s hug, and I hugged him back. ****
	
	“Come on! I have to show you my latest Minecraft creations. Also, what games are you playing now? Maybe we can team up and play Counter-Strike together. Or maybe…” He went on and on and on. Most people would get irritated at his chattiness. Not me. I loved this about him.
	
	For three weeks, I was coming back to my virtual home, playing video games and watching TV and movies with my little brother. We would hop from one location to another, and he didn’t question how we got to the Great Wall of China from our house in mere seconds.
	
	The VR disorientation was becoming more and more pronounced. I would lose focus during meetings. The objects at my desk would seem to float. My hands felt like they were detaching from my arms and then snap back as soon as I notice them drifting away. It all sounds weird, but it happens. *****
	
	Despite all that, I was happy.
	
	Then I received an email from VR-GL, stating that the beta test was terminated. The word “terminated” was worrying. Did they mean the beta test was over? Or did they mean they were terminating the whole project?
	
	The thought made me so ill that I had to leave work early. I rushed back home, tried to open the launcher, only to be met with a pop-up that said: Server Not Found. I tried again and again, hoping it would glitch and get me in that world so I can say good-bye and say I love you to my little brother.
	
	Fuck. I lost him again.
	
	So fuck it! Maybe I’m not breaking the NDA since the program has been terminated. All I want to know is that I’m not alone, that someone also had tested this VR app. I feel like I’m losing my mind because *VR-GL S.r.l* is not showing up in Google or any other search engines. It was like Facebook had scrubbed them off the internet.
	
	There must be a clue or a remnant of VR-GL because, as we all know, nothing really dies in the internet. [Not even my little brother.](http://jonmayo.blogspot.com)

	I once heard a story from a radio, it's name was 105.9, I think. There were two men speaking, and then one of them shared a story.
	
	"...wow, kind of weird yet unsettling at the same time. I think I understand it. The guy who was so silent yet handsome got invited by that female student, and then the guy tried to follow her, eventually leading him to a tree, where, the most weirdest part happens, right? He wore a flower on his head and he had leaves on his pockets.
	
	Then, the mother asked him why he did that, and he answered that he found the found beautiful woman, so he decided to answer her invitation.
	
	What I think happened is that the female girl was trying to pull the guy to her world or maybe she was a ghost that was longing for love? A lot of explanations for that one.
	
	...once again, thank you Dennis for sharing your story.
	
	You know,  y yaya, or in English, my maid, told me that before she got to me, she took care of a girl. She said that she got paid well and that the girl she took care of was a careful young lady.
	
	Then, the girl just disappeared. Gone. My maid said that the girl was just playing in a field and then somehow, she just disappeared.
	
	The family never found the girl after a long time.
	
	Well, not until the girl came back.
	
	My yaya said that the girl said that she was just out for 5 minutes. The girl said that she was suddenly just grabbed by someone to somewhere she doesn't remember and then she shortly came back to her house.
	
	Of course, the family didn't want to believe this. However, they just had to. Their daughter never lied before, and if she did, she would up and just tell them.
	
	A day later, everything came back to the norm. Well, the strangeness of the matter still made the family unsettled, but they acted normal because the girl really believed that she was just out for 5 minutes.
	
	However, the maid and the family really know that the girl's been gone for months. The police couldn't find her, even themselves couldn't find her. Her friends and relatives tried to help but they couldn't find her. She's just disappeared from the face of the Earth.
	
	Everything seemed to come back to normal, and everyone just pretended that nothing strange happened, so that their girl won't be confused and conflicted.
	
	And then the most strangest thing happened three days later, because the girl died of Pneumonia. The cause or the origin of where she got it was unknown, and this threw off the entire family, because they just lost their daughter for months, thinking that she died but then coming back to only die three days later.
	
	The family knew that something was wrong. Very, very, very wrong, but they couldn't point to what it could possibly be."
