Random programs for reddit

So what is this repository?
Just a hobby I have messing with PRAW. 

I started using the PRAW to mess around and improve my programming skills, as comp. sci. is not my educational background.
I had taken intro. to comp. sci. and intro to python my first year of college, but those classes didn't teach me 

I had an internship as a systems engineer dealing with system requirements for a legacy system.
We used a relational database, and most of the work was done by filtering in excel.
Sometimes the tasks would be very tedious, so I kind of taught myself how to use python to make some of these tasks easier. 

My PRAW adventures started as a way for me to practice programming/data management. 

You can do a lot of neat things with PRAW, and it's a great way to make useful projects.

A problem I have with intro to programming classes is all of the skills you learn are correct, but the projects are usually unimportant.
A typical intro to programming project will be to make a dungeon. 
This will obviously introduce students to 2-D lists/arrays for the floor map, and dictionaries/hash tables for the weapons. 
But it's useless! These projects feel as if you're accomplishing nothing real, tangible, or even remotely important. 
It's hard for a student to connect these projects with what programming is actually useful for. 
But PRAW makes finding useful projects to connect learning simple.

Because programming is so hands on, finding projects that feel important to you is so important when you start programming. 
I feel that the irrelevance of most intro. to programming projects leads many people to label programming as boring.



PRAW limits you to a thousand posts in a response, and I've been too lazy to learn how to use pushshift so there's that.

If you notice an issue or have a question please post it in issues. 
I am not a programming guru, so I may be doing things in not the most efficient way, and my code may not be the most "correct"!

A note on -

from authenticate import authenticate 
reddit = authenticate() 

I started to use a module I made that has all of my reddit API authentification info and a link to my reddit repository on github. 
You must the API info secret or you can get banned from using it. 
This allows me to upload code without having to worry about changing the authentification info every time I upload.
